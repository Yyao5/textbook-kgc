0,monitor,introduces,significant network communication
1,CPU  utilization,reported,100 Mbps network
2,native  VMM,executes,larger  instructions
4,overheads,reported for other,particular  Xen
6,we,examine,basic  network
8,privileged  operations,executed,I
9,driver domain,refer to,guest domain
12,native network interface which,called,also network adapter
14,precisely guest OS,uses,back driver domain
15,guest domain,communicates with,driver domain
20,it,added to,table
22,bridge,uses,rather broadcast packet
24,bridge,performs,multiplexing driver demultiplexing
25,packets,have,different  VMM
27,Similarly  packets,have,single network adaptor
29,Xen,supports,address translation
30,Table,shows,well Xen optimizations
32,optimization,discussed in,i
33,Next  we,examine,virtual optimization interface
35,interface,provides,low level network primitives
36,design,supports,e.g. scatter gather DMA
