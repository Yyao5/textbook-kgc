<p class="p1">Cloud computing is based on a paradigm shift with profound implications for computing ethics. The</p>
<p class="p1">main elements of this shift are: (i) the control is relinquished to third-party services; (ii) the data is</p>
<p class="p1">stored on multiple sites administered by several organizations; and (iii) multiple services interoperate</p>
<p class="p1">across the network.</p>
<p class="p1">Unauthorized access, data corruption, infrastructure failure, and service unavailability are some of</p>
<p class="p1">the risks related to relinquishing the control to third-party services; moreover, whenever a problem</p>
<p class="p1">occurs, it is difficult to identify the source and the entity causing it. Systems can span the boundaries</p>
<p class="p1">of multiple organizations and cross security borders, a process called <span class="s1">deperimeterization</span>. As a result of</p>
<p class="p1">deperimeterization, “not only the border of the organization’s IT infrastructure blurs, also the border of</p>
<p class="p1">the accountability becomes less clear” [<span class="s2">350</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">The complex structure of cloud services can make it difficult to determine who is responsible in</p>
<p class="p1">case something undesirable happens. In a complex chain of events or systems, many entities contribute</p>
<p class="p1">to an action, with undesirable consequences. Some of them have the opportunity to prevent these</p>
<p class="p1">consequences, and therefore no one can be held responsible – the so-called “problem of many hands.”</p>
<p class="p1">Ubiquitous and unlimited data sharing and storage among organizations test the self-determination</p>
<p class="p1">of information, the right or ability of individuals to exercise personal control over the collection, and</p>
<p class="p1">use and disclosure of their personal data by others; this tests the confidence and trust in today’s evolving</p>
<p class="p1">information society. Identity fraud and theft are made possible by the unauthorized access to personal</p>
<p class="p1">data in circulation and by new forms of dissemination through social networks, which could also pose</p>
<p class="p1">a danger to cloud computing.</p>
<p class="p1">Cloud service providers have already collected petabytes of sensitive personal information stored in</p>
<p class="p1">data centers around the world. The acceptance of cloud computing therefore will be determined by privacy</p>
<p class="p1">issues addressed by these companies and the countries where the data centers are located. Privacy</p>
<p class="p1">is affected by cultural differences; though some cultures favor privacy, other cultures emphasize community,</p>
<p class="p1">and this leads to an ambivalent attitude toward privacy on the Internet, which is a global system. The question of what can be done proactively about ethics of cloud computing does not have easy</p>
<p class="p1">answers; many undesirable phenomena in cloud computing will only appear in time. However, the need</p>
<p class="p1">for rules and regulations for the governance of cloud computing is obvious. The term <span class="s1">governance </span>means</p>
<p class="p1">the manner in which something is governed or regulated, the method of management, or the system of</p>
<p class="p1">regulations. Explicit attention to ethics must be paid by governmental organizations providing research</p>
<p class="p1">funding for cloud computing; private companies are less constrained by ethics oversight and governance</p>
<p class="p1">arrangements are more conducive to profit generation.</p>
<p class="p1">Accountability is a necessary ingredient of cloud computing; adequate information about how data</p>
<p class="p1">is handled within the cloud and about allocation of responsibility are key elements for enforcing ethics</p>
<p class="p1">rules in cloud computing. Recorded evidence allows us to assign responsibility; but there can be tension</p>
<p class="p1">between privacy and accountability, and it is important to establish what is being recorded and who</p>
<p class="p1">has access to the records.</p>
<p class="p1">Unwanted dependency on a cloud service provider, the so-called <span class="s1">vendor lock-in</span>, is a serious concern,</p>
<p class="p1">and the current standardization efforts at NIST attempt to address this problem.Another concern for users</p>
<p class="p1">is a future with only a handful of companies that dominate the market and dictate prices and policies.</p>
