<p class="p1">According to the NIST reference model in Figure <span class="s1">1.2 </span>[<span class="s1">260</span>], the entities involved in cloud computing</p>
<p class="p1">are the <span class="s2">service consumer</span>, the entity that maintains a business relationship with and uses service from</p>
<p class="p1">service providers; the <span class="s2">service provider</span>, the entity responsible for making a service available to service</p>
<p class="p1">consumers; the <span class="s2">carrier</span>, the intermediary that provides connectivity and transport of cloud services</p>
<p class="p1">between providers and consumers; the <span class="s2">broker</span>, an entity that manages the use, performance, and delivery</p>
<p class="p1">of cloud services and negotiates relationships between providers and consumers; and the <span class="s2">auditor</span>, a party</p>
<p class="p1">that can conduct independent assessment of cloud services, information system operations, performance,</p>
<p class="p1">and security of the cloud implementation. An <span class="s2">audit </span>is a systematic evaluation of a cloud system that</p>
<p class="p1">measures how well it conforms to a set of established criteria. For example, a security audit evaluates cloud security, a privacy-impact audit evaluates cloud privacy assurance, and a performance audit</p>
<p class="p1">evaluates cloud performance.</p>
<p class="p1">We start with the observation that it is difficult to distinguish the services associated with cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing from those that any computer operations center would include [<span class="s1">332</span>]. Many of the services</p>
<p class="p1">discussed in this section could be provided by a cloud architecture, but note that they are available in</p>
<p class="p1">noncloud architectures as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Figure <span class="s1">1.3 </span>presents the structure of the three delivery models, <span class="s2">SaaS</span>, <span class="s2">PaaS</span>, and <span class="s2">IaaS</span>, according to</p>
<p class="p1">the Cloud Security Alliance [<span class="s1">98</span>].</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Software-as-a-Service </span>(SaaS) gives the capability to use applications supplied by the service provider</p>
<p class="p1">in a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin-client interface such as aWeb browser (e.g.,Web-based email). The user does not manage or control the underlying</p>
<p class="p1">cloud infrastructure, including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual</p>
<p class="p1">application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration</p>
<p class="p1">settings. Services offered include:</p>
<p class="p1">• Enterprise services such as workflow management, groupware and collaborative, supply chain,</p>
<p class="p1">communications, digital signature, customer relationship management (CRM), desktop software,</p>
<p class="p1">financial management, geo-spatial, and search [<span class="s1">32</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">• Web 2.0 applications such as metadata management, social networking, blogs, wiki services, and</p>
<p class="p1">portal services.</p>
<p class="p1">The <span class="s2">SaaS </span>is not suitable for applications that require real-time response or those for which data is</p>
<p class="p1">not allowed to be hosted externally. The most likely candidates for <span class="s2">SaaS </span>are applications for which:</p>
<p class="p1">• Many competitors use the same product, such as email.</p>
<p class="p1">• Periodically there is a significant peak in demand, such as billing and payroll.</p>
<p class="p1">• There is a need for Web or mobile access, such as mobile sales management software.</p>
<p class="p1">• There is only a short-term need, such as collaborative software for a project.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Platform-as-a-Service </span>(PaaS) gives the capability to deploy consumer-created or acquired applications</p>
<p class="p1">using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The user does not manage</p>
<p class="p1">or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, including network, servers, operating systems, or storage.</p>
<p class="p1">The user has control over the deployed applications and, possibly, over the application hosting</p>
<p class="p1">environment configurations. Such services include session management, device integration, sandboxes,</p>
<p class="p1">instrumentation and testing, contentsmanagement, knowledge management, and UniversalDescription,</p>
<p class="p1">Discovery, and Integration (UDDI), a platform-independent Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based</p>
<p class="p1">registry providing a mechanism to register and locate Web service applications.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">PaaS </span>is not particulary useful when the application must be portable, when proprietary programming</p>
<p class="p1">languages are used, or when the underlaying hardware and software must be customized to improve</p>
<p class="p1">the performance of the application. The major <span class="s2">PaaS </span>application areas are in software development</p>
<p class="p1">where multiple developers and users collaborate and the deployment and testing services should be</p>
<p class="p1">automated.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Infrastructure-as-a-Service </span>(IaaS) is the capability to provision processing, storage, networks, and</p>
<p class="p1">other fundamental computing resources; the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software,</p>
<p class="p1">which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the</p>
<p class="p1">underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications,</p>
<p class="p1">and possibly limited control of some networking components, such as host firewalls. Services offered</p>
<p class="p1">by this delivery model include: server hosting, Web servers, storage, computing hardware, operating</p>
<p class="p1">systems, virtual instances, load balancing, Internet access, and bandwidth provisioning.</p>
<p class="p1">The <span class="s2">IaaS </span>cloud computing delivery model has a number of characteristics, such as the fact that the</p>
<p class="p1">resources are distributed and support dynamic scaling, it is based on a utility pricing model and variable</p>
<p class="p1">cost, and the hardware is shared among multiple users. This cloud computingmodel is particulary useful</p>
<p class="p1">when the demand is volatile and a new business needs computing resources and does not want to invest</p>
<p class="p1">in a computing infrastructure or when an organization is expanding rapidly.</p>
<p class="p1">A number of activities are necessary to support the three delivery models; they include:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">1. </span>Service management and provisioning, including virtualization, service provisioning, call center,</p>
<p class="p1">operations management, systems management, QoS management, billing and accounting, asset</p>
<p class="p1">management, SLA management, technical support, and backups.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">2. </span>Security management, including ID and authentication, certification and accreditation, intrusion</p>
<p class="p1">prevention, intrusion detection, virus protection, cryptography, physical security, incident response,</p>
<p class="p1">access control, audit and trails, and firewalls.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">3. </span>Customer services such as customer assistance and online help, subscriptions, business intelligence,</p>
<p class="p1">reporting, customer preferences, and personalization.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">4. </span>Integration services, including data management and development.</p>
<p class="p1">This list shows that a service-oriented architecture involves multiple subsystems and complex interactions</p>
<p class="p1">among these subsystems. Individual subsystems can be layered; for example, in Figure <span class="s1">1.2 </span>we</p>
<p class="p1">see that the service layer sits on top of a resource abstraction layer, which controls the physical resource</p>
<p class="p1">layer.</p>
