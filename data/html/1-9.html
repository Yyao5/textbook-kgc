<p class="p1">John McCarthy was a visionary in computer science; in the early 1960s he formulated the idea that</p>
<p class="p1">computation may be organized as a public utility, like water and electricity. In 1992 Gordon Bell was</p>
<p class="p1">invited to and delivered an address at a conference on parallel computations with the provocative title</p>
<p class="p2">Massively parallel computers: why not parallel computers for themasses? <span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">45</span><span class="s1">]; he argued that one-of-akind</span></p>
<p class="p1">systems are not only expensive to build, but the cost of rewriting applications for them is prohibitive.</p>
<p class="p1">Google Inc. was founded by Page and Brin, two graduate students in computer science at Stanford</p>
<p class="p1">University; in 1998 the company was incorporated in California after receiving a contribution of</p>
<p class="p1">$100, 000 from the co-founder and chief hardware designer of Sun Microsystems, Andy Bechtolsheim.</p>
<p class="p1">Amazon <span class="s3">EC2 </span>was initially released as a limited public beta cloud computing service on August 25,</p>
<p class="p1">2006. The system was developed by a team from Cape Town, South Africa. In October 2008 Microsoft</p>
<p class="p1">announced the <span class="s3">Windows Azure </span>platform; in June 2010 the platform became commercially available.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">iCloud</span>, a cloud storage and cloud computing service from Apple Inc., stores content such as music,</p>
<p class="p1">photos, calendars, and documents and allows users to access it from Apple devices. The system was</p>
<p class="p1">announced on June 6, 2011. In 2012 the Oracle Cloud was announced (see <span class="s4">www.oracle.com/us/</span></p>
