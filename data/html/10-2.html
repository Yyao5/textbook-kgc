<p class="p1">Abstraction is one of the means to cope with system complexity, but abstractions could drive us away</p>
<p class="p1">from physical reality. We should not forget that our objective is to build systems that store, transform,</p>
<p class="p1">and transport information and that the physical properties of such systems must be well understood.</p>
<p class="p1">Three fundamental abstractions are sufficient to describe all possible elements of computing and</p>
<p class="p1">communication systems: storage, interpreter, and communication channel. An interpreter is an active</p>
<p class="p1">element of a system that transforms information; we distinguish hardware interpreters, such as a processor</p>
<p class="p1">or a disk controller, from software interpreters, such as scripting languages and text-processing</p>
<p class="p1">systems. In all the possible embodiments of this abstraction, the interpreter, we recognize three elements</p>
<p class="p1">[<span class="s1">312</span>]: (i) an action reference, which tells the interpreter where to find the next action; (ii) a repertoire,</p>
<p class="p1">which defines the set of actions the interpreter is able to perform; and (iii) an environment reference,</p>
<p class="p1">which points to the environment and the state in which the interpreter should be when executing the next</p>
<p class="p1">action. The physical properties of actual embodiments of an interpreter span a very large spectrum; for</p>
<p class="p1">example, when we design an application for a mobile device, a major concern in selecting the processor</p>
<p class="p1">should be its power consumption, whereas the main concern for the browser should be the size of the</p>
<p class="p1">screen.</p>
<p class="p1">Information has a physical support, and each one of these three processes acts on a property of that</p>
<p class="p1">physical system. For example, to transport information from a sender to a receiver, we can encode it in the amplitude, the frequency, or the phase of electromagnetic waves, and we have to well understand</p>
<p class="p1">the interaction of the electromagnetic waves with the communication media. Indeed, if we want to</p>
<p class="p1">have error-free communication channels we have to determine the error rate and use error-correcting or</p>
<p class="p1">error-detecting code designed to cope with the error rate.</p>
<p class="p1">We have to maintain a delicate balance between the abstractions that are critical to the development</p>
<p class="p1">of algorithms and the physical characteristics of the systems used to store, transform, and transport</p>
<p class="p1">information. This balance has shifted in recent years due to the widespread use of <span class="s2">cyberphysical systems</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">In such systems there is a tight relationship between the computational elements and the physical</p>
<p class="p1">elements. Embedded systems are ubiquitous, and sensors allow them to react to the properties of the</p>
<p class="p1">physical systems they control and, at the same time, to monitor their own properties and adapt to changes</p>
<p class="p1">in the environment.</p>
<p class="p1">One dimension of the design of modern complex systems is related to their operational environment.</p>
<p class="p1">The recently introduced concept of <span class="s2">sociotechnical systems </span>(see, for example, [<span class="s1">329</span>]) captures the fact</p>
<p class="p1">that the design of modern systems should consider not only the technological aspect but also the</p>
<p class="p1">environment â€“ more precisely, the humans who use a system.</p>
<p class="p1">From this informal discussion of several attributes of complex systems we move to quantitative</p>
<p class="p1">measures of system complexity, the topic of the next section.</p>
