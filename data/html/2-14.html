<p class="p1">Seminal papers in distributed systems have been authored by Mani Chandy and Leslie Lamport [<span class="s1">72</span>],</p>
<p class="p1">by Leslie Lamport [<span class="s1">205</span>â€“<span class="s1">207</span>], Hoare [<span class="s1">168</span>], and Milner [<span class="s1">244</span>]. The collection of contributions with the</p>
<p class="p1">title <span class="s2">Distributed systems</span>, edited by Sape Mullender, includes some of these papers.</p>
<p class="p1">Petri nets were introduced in [<span class="s1">291</span>]. An in-depth discussion of concurrency theory and system modeling</p>
<p class="p1">with PNs can be found in [<span class="s1">292</span>]. The brief discussion of distributed systems leads to the observation</p>
<p class="p1">that the analysis of communicating processes requires a more formal framework. Hoare realized that a</p>
<p class="p1">language based on execution traces is insufficient to abstract the behavior of communicating processes</p>
<p class="p1">and developed <span class="s2">communicating sequential processes </span>(CSPs) [<span class="s1">168</span>]. More recently, Milner initiated an</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">axiomatic theory called the </span>Calculus of Communicating Systems <span class="s3">(CCS) [</span><span class="s4">244</span><span class="s3">]. </span>Process algebra <span class="s3">is the</span></p>
<p class="p1">study of concurrent communicating processes within an algebraic framework. The process behavior is</p>
<p class="p1">modeled as a set of equational axioms and a set of operators. This approach has its own limitations, the</p>
<p class="p1">real-time behavior of the processes, so true concurrency still escapes this axiomatization.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The text </span>Computer networks: a top-down approach featuring the internet<span class="s3">, by J. A. Kurose and K.</span></p>
<p class="p1">W. Ross is a good introduction to networking. A recent text of Saltzer and Kaashoek [<span class="s1">312</span>] covers basic</p>
<p class="p1">concepts in computer system design.</p>
