<p class="p1">A 1989 survey of distributed file systems can be found in [<span class="s1">316</span>]. NFS Versions 2, 3, and 4 are defined</p>
<p class="p1">in RFCs 1094, 1813, and 3010, respectively. NFS Version 3 added a number of features, including</p>
<p class="p1">support for 64-bit file sizes and offsets, support for asynchronous writes on the server, additional file attributes in many replies, and a <span class="s2">readdirplus </span>operation. These extensions allowed the new version</p>
<p class="p1">to handle files larger than 2 GB, to improve performance, and to get file handles and attributes along</p>
<p class="p1">with file names when scanning a directory. NFS Version 4 borrowed a few features from the Andrew</p>
<p class="p1">File System. WebNFS is an extension of NFS Versions 2 and 3; it enables operations through firewalls</p>
<p class="p1">and is more easily integrated into Web browsers.</p>
<p class="p1">AFS was developed at CMU in collaboration with IBM [<span class="s1">250</span>]; it was further developed as an opensource</p>
<p class="p1">system by IBM under the name OpenAFS in 2000. Sprite [<span class="s1">165</span>] was developed at UC Berkeley</p>
<p class="p1">in the mid-1980s. Locus [<span class="s1">365</span>] was initially developed at UCLA in the early 1980s and its development</p>
<p class="p1">was continued by Locus Computing Corporation. Apollo [<span class="s1">211</span>] was developed at Apollo Computer Inc.,</p>
<p class="p1">established in 1980 and acquired in 1989 by HP. The Remote File System (RFS) [<span class="s1">35</span>] was developed at</p>
<p class="p1">Bell Labs in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p class="p1">The documentation of a current version of GPFS and an analysis of the caching strategy are given</p>
<p class="p1">in GPFS [<span class="s1">177</span>] and [<span class="s1">317</span>], respectively.</p>
<p class="p1">Several generations of DBMSs based on different models have been developed through the years.</p>
<p class="p1">In 1968 IBM released the Information Management System (IMS) for IBM 360 computers; IMS was</p>
<p class="p1">based on the so-called <span class="s3">navigational model</span>, which supported manual navigation in a linked data set</p>
<p class="p1">where the data was organized hierarchically. The relational database management system (RDBMS)</p>
<p class="p1">model was introduced in 1970 by Codd [<span class="s1">87</span>]; in this model related records are linked together and can</p>
<p class="p1">be accessed using a unique <span class="s3">key</span>. Codd also introduced a <span class="s3">tuple calculus </span>as a basis for a query model for</p>
<p class="p1">an RDBMS; this led to the development of the Structured Query Language (SQL).</p>
<p class="p1">In 1973, the Ingres research project at UC Berkeley developed an RDBMS; several companies,</p>
<p class="p1">including Sybase, Informix, NonStop SQL, and Ingres, were established to create SQL RDBMS commercial</p>
<p class="p1">products based on the ideas generated by the Ingres project. IBMâ€™s DB2 and SQL/DS dominated</p>
<p class="p1">the RDBMS market for main frames during the later years of the 1980s. TheOracleCorporation, founded</p>
<p class="p1">in 1977, was also involved in the development of RDBMS.</p>
<p class="p1">The ACID properties of database transactions were defined by Jim Gray in 1981 [<span class="s1">143</span>] and the term</p>
<p class="p1">ACID was introduced in [<span class="s1">156</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">The object-oriented programming ideas of the 1980s led to the development of <span class="s3">object-oriented</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">database management systems (OODBMSs) </span>in which the information is packaged as objects. The ideas</p>
<p class="p1">developed by several research projects, including Encore-Ob/Server at Brown University, Exodus at the</p>
<p class="p1">University ofWisconsin at Madison, Iris atHP, ODE at Bell Labs, and theOrion project at MCC-Austin,</p>
<p class="p1">helped the development of several OODBMS commercial products [<span class="s1">191</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">The so-called <span class="s3">NoSQL </span>database management systems emerged in the 2000s. They do not follow</p>
<p class="p1">the RDBMS model, do not use SQL as a query language, may not give ACID grantees, and have a</p>
<p class="p1">distributed, fault-tolerant architecture.</p>
