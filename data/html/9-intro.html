<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Security has been a concern since the early days of computing, when a computer was isolated in a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">room and a threat could be posed only by malicious insiders. The Pandora’s box</span><span class="s2">1 </span><span class="s1">of threats opened</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wide once computers were able to communicate with one another. In an interconnected world, various</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">embodiments of malware can migrate easily from one system to another, cross national borders, and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">infect systems all over the globe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The security of computing and communication systems takes on a new urgency as society becomes</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">increasingly dependent on the information infrastructure. Nowadays, even the critical infrastructure</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a nation can be attacked by exploiting flaws in computer security. Malware, such as the Stuxnet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">virus, targets industrial control systems controlled by software [</span><span class="s3">81</span><span class="s1">]. Recently, the term </span><span class="s4">cyberwarfare</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">has entered the dictionary with the meaning “actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation’s</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption” [</span><span class="s3">85</span><span class="s1">].</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A computer cloud is a target-rich environment for malicious individuals and criminal organizations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is thus no surprise that security is a major concern for existing users and for potential new users</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of cloud computing services. In Section 3.10 we identified some of the security threats perceived by</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cloud users; in Section </span><span class="s3">9.1 </span><span class="s1">we elaborate on this topic. Some of these risks are shared with other systems</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">supporting network-centric computing and network-centric content, e.g., service-oriented architectures</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(SOAs), grids, and Web-based services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cloud computing is an entirely new approach to computing based on a new technology. It is therefore</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reasonable to expect that new methods to deal with some of the security threats will be developed,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whereas other perceived threats will prove to be exaggerated. Indeed, “early on in the life cycle of a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">technology, there are many concerns about how this technology will be used </span><span class="s4">. . . </span><span class="s1">they represent a barrier</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the acceptance </span><span class="s4">. . . </span><span class="s1">over the time, however, the concerns fade, especially if the value proposition is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strong enough” [</span><span class="s3">174</span><span class="s1">].</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea that moving to a cloud liberates an organization from many technical concerns related to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">computer security and eliminates internal threats is accepted by some members of the IT community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we shall see throughout this chapter, this seems a rather na</span><span class="s5"> </span><span class="s1">ve point of view, because outsourcing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">computing to a cloud generates major new security and privacy concerns. Moreover, service-level</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">agreements do not provide adequate legal protection for cloud computer users, who are often left to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">deal with events beyond their control.</span></p>
