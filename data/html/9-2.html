<p class="p1">Virtually all surveys report that security is the top concern for cloud users, who are accustomed to having</p>
<p class="p1">full control of all systems onwhich sensitive information is stored and processed. Users typically operate</p>
<p class="p1">inside a secure perimeter protected by a corporate firewall. In spite of the potential threats, users have to</p>
<p class="p1">extend their trust to the cloud service provider if they want to benefit from the economical advantages</p>
<p class="p1">of utility computing. This is a fairly difficult transition, yet it is a critical one for the future of cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing. To support this transition, some argue that cloud security is in the hands of experts, so users</p>
<p class="p1">are even better protected than when they are in charge of their own security.</p>
<p class="p1">Major user concerns are unauthorized access to confidential information and data theft. Data is more</p>
<p class="p1">vulnerable in storage than while it is being processed. Data is kept in storage for extended periods of</p>
<p class="p1">time, whereas it is exposed to threats during processing for relatively short periods of time. Hence, close</p>
<p class="p1">attention should be paid to the security of storage servers and to data in transit.</p>
<p class="p1">This does not mean that threats during processing can be ignored; such threats can originate from</p>
<p class="p1">flaws in the VMM, rogue VMs, or a VMBR, as discussed in Section 5.12. There is also the risk of</p>
<p class="p1">unauthorized access and data theft posed by rogue employees of a cloud service provider (CSP). The</p>
<p class="p1">hiring and security screening policies of the CSP personnel are totally opaque processes to users, and</p>
<p class="p1">this justifies users’ concern about insider attacks.</p>
<p class="p1">The next concerns regard user control over the life cycle of data. It is virtually impossible for a user</p>
<p class="p1">to determine whether data that should have been deleted is actually deleted. Even if it was deleted, there</p>
<p class="p1">is no guarantee that the media was wiped and the next user is not able to recover confidential data. This</p>
<p class="p1">problem is exacerbated because the CSPs rely on seamless backups to prevent accidental data loss. Such</p>
<p class="p1">backups are done without users’ consent or knowledge. During this exercise data records can be lost,</p>
<p class="p1">accidentally deleted, or accessible to an attacker.</p>
<p class="p1">Lack of standardization is next on the list of concerns. Today there are no interoperability standards,</p>
<p class="p1">as we discussed in Section 3.5. Many questions do not have satisfactory answers at this time. For</p>
<p class="p1">example: What can be done when the service provided by the CSP is interrupted? How can we access</p>
<p class="p1">our critically needed data in case of a blackout? What if the CSP drastically raises its prices? What is</p>
<p class="p1">the cost of moving to a different CSP?</p>
<p class="p1">It is undeniable that auditing and compliance pose an entirely different set of challenges in cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing. These challenges are not yet resolved.Afull audit trail on a cloud is an infeasible proposition</p>
<p class="p1">at this time.</p>
<p class="p1">Another, less analyzed user concern is that cloud computing is based on a new technology expected</p>
<p class="p1">to evolve in the future. Case in point: autonomic computing is likely to enter the scene. When this</p>
<p class="p1">happens, self-organization, self-optimization, self-repair, and self-healing could generate additional</p>
<p class="p1">security threats. In an autonomic system it will be even more difficult than at present to determine when</p>
<p class="p1">an action occurred, what was the reason for that action, and how it created the opportunity for an attack</p>
<p class="p1">or for data loss. It is still unclear how autonomic computing can be compliant with privacy and legal</p>
<p class="p1">issues.</p>
<p class="p1">There is no doubt that multitenancy is the root cause of many user concerns. Nevertheless, multitenancy</p>
<p class="p1">enables a higher server utilization thus, lower costs. Because it is one of the pillars of utility</p>
<p class="p1">computing, users have to learn to live with multitenancy. The threats caused by multitenancy differ</p>
<p class="p1">from one cloud delivery model to another. For example, in the case of <span class="s1">SaaS</span>, private information such</p>
<p class="p1">as name, address, phone numbers, and possibly credit card numbers of many users is stored on one</p>
<p class="p1">server, and when the security of that server is compromised, a large number of users are affected. We</p>
<p class="p1">have already mentioned that multitenancy threats during processing time cannot be ignored.</p>
<p class="p1">Users are also greatly concerned about the legal framework for enforcing cloud computing security.</p>
<p class="p1">The cloud technology has moved much faster than cloud security and privacy legislation, so users have</p>
<p class="p1">legitimate concerns regarding the ability to defend their rights. Because the data centers of a CSP may</p>
<p class="p1">be located in several countries, it is difficult to understand which laws apply – the laws of the country</p>
<p class="p1">where information is stored and processed, the laws of the countries where the information crossed</p>
<p class="p1">from the user to the datacenter, or the laws of the country where the user is located.</p>
<p class="p1">To make matters even more complicated, a CSP may outsource the handling of personal and/or</p>
<p class="p1">sensitive information. Existing laws stating that the CSP must exercise reasonable security may be</p>
<p class="p1">difficult to implement in a case where there is a chain of outsourcing to companies in different countries.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, a CSP may be required by law to share private data with law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p class="p1">Now we examine briefly what cloud users can and should do to minimize security risks regarding</p>
<p class="p1">data handling by the CSP. First, users should evaluate the security policies and the mechanisms the CSP</p>
<p class="p1">has in place to enforce these policies. Then users should analyze the information that would be stored</p>
<p class="p1">and processed on the cloud. Finally, the contractual obligations should be clearly spelled out.</p>
<p class="p1">The contract between the user and the CSP should do the following [<span class="s2">290</span>]:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. </span>State explicitly the CSP’s obligations to securely handle sensitive information and its obligation to</p>
<p class="p1">comply with privacy laws.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. </span>Spell out CSP liabilities for mishandling sensitive information.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. </span>Spell out CSP liabilities for data loss.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. </span>Spell out the rules governing the ownership of the data.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. </span>Specify the geographical regions where information and backups can be stored.</p>
<p class="p1">To minimize security risks, a user may try to avoid processing sensitive data on a cloud. The Secure</p>
<p class="p1">Data Connector from Google carries out an analysis of the data structures involved and allows users to</p>
<p class="p1">access data protected by a firewall. This solution is not feasible for several classes of application, e.g., processing of medical or personnel records. It may not be feasible when the cloud processing workflow</p>
<p class="p1">requires cloud access to the entire volume of user data.</p>
<p class="p1">When the volume of sensitive data or the processing workflow requires sensitive data to be stored</p>
<p class="p1">on a public or hybrid cloud, then, whenever feasible, data should be encrypted. This poses a dilemma</p>
<p class="p1">because encryption prevents indexing and searching the data. For some applications it is possible to</p>
<p class="p1">scramble the data to make it unintelligible to an intruder. Though this system is extremely inefficient,</p>
<p class="p1">hence impractical at this time, it is possible to process encrypted data using either a fully homomorphic</p>
<p class="p1">encryption scheme [<span class="s2">134</span>] or secure two-party computations [<span class="s2">380</span>].</p>
