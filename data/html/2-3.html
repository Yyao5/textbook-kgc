<p class="p1">A <span class="s1">distributed system </span>is a collection of autonomous computers that are connected through a network and</p>
<p class="p1">distribution software called <span class="s1">middleware</span>, which enables computers to coordinate their activities and to</p>
<p class="p1">share the resources of the system. A distributed system’s users perceive the system as a single integrated</p>
<p class="p1">computing facility.</p>
<p class="p1">A distributed system has several characteristics: Its components are autonomous, scheduling and</p>
<p class="p1">other resource management and security policies are implemented by each system, there are multiple</p>
<p class="p1">points of control and multiple points of failure, and the resources may not be accessible at all times.</p>
<p class="p1">Distributed systems can be scaled by adding additional resources and can be designed to maintain</p>
<p class="p1">availability even at low levels of hardware/software/network reliability.</p>
<p class="p1">Distributed systems have been around for several decades. For example, distributed file systems and</p>
<p class="p1">network file systems have been used for user convenience and to improve reliability and functionality of</p>
<p class="p1">file systems for many years. Modern operating systems allow a user to <span class="s1">mount </span>a remote file system and</p>
<p class="p1">access it the same way a local file system is accessed, yet with a performance penalty due to larger communication</p>
<p class="p1">costs. The <span class="s1">remote procedure call </span>(RPC) supports inter-process communication and allows a</p>
<p class="p1">procedure on a system to invoke a procedure running in a different address space, possibly on a remote</p>
<p class="p1">system. RPCs were introduced in the early 1970s by Bruce Nelson and used for the first time at Xerox;</p>
<p class="p1">the Network File System (NFS) introduced in 1984 was based on Sun’s RPC. Many programming languages</p>
<p class="p1">support RPCs; for example, Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) provides a functionality</p>
<p class="p1">similar to that of <span class="s1">UNIX </span>RPC methods, and XML-RPC uses XML to encode HTML-based calls.</p>
<p class="p1">The middleware should support a set of desirable properties of a distributed system:</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Access transparency. </span>Local and remote information objects are accessed using identical operations.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Location transparency. </span>Information objects are accessed without knowledge of their location.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Concurrency transparency. </span>Several processes run concurrently using shared information objects</p>
<p class="p1">without interference among them.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Replication transparency. </span>Multiple instances of information objects are used to increase reliability</p>
<p class="p1">without the knowledge of users or applications.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Failure transparency. </span>The concealment of faults.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Migration transparency. </span>The information objects in the system are moved without affecting the</p>
<p class="p1">operation performed on them.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Performance transparency. </span>The system can be reconfigured based on the load and quality of service</p>
<p class="p1">requirements.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s1">Scaling transparency. </span>The system and the applications can scale without a change in the system</p>
<p class="p1">structure and without affecting the applications.</p>
