<p class="p1">A <span class="s1">service-level agreement (SLA) </span>is a negotiated contract between two parties, the customer and the</p>
<p class="p1">service provider. The agreement can be legally binding or informal and specifies the services that</p>
<p class="p1">the customer receive rather than how the service provider delivers the services. The objectives of the</p>
<p class="p1">agreement are:</p>
<p class="p1">• Identify and define customers’ needs and constraints, including the level of resources, security,</p>
<p class="p1">timing, and quality of service.</p>
<p class="p1">• Provide a framework for understanding. A critical aspect of this framework is a clear definition of</p>
<p class="p1">classes of service and costs.</p>
<p class="p1">• Simplify complex issues; for example, clarify the boundaries between the responsibilities of the</p>
<p class="p1">clients and those of the provider of service in case of failures.</p>
<p class="p1">• Reduce areas of conflict.</p>
<p class="p1">• Encourage dialogue in the event of disputes.</p>
<p class="p1">• Eliminate unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p class="p1">An SLA records a common understanding in several areas: (i) services, (ii) priorities, (iii) responsibilities,</p>
<p class="p1">(iv) guarantees, and (v) warranties. An agreement usually covers: services to be delivered,</p>
<p class="p1">performance, tracking and reporting, problem management, legal compliance and resolution of disputes,</p>
<p class="p1">customer duties and responsibilities, security, handling of confidential information, and termination.</p>
<p class="p1">Each area of service in cloud computing should define a “target level of service” or a “minimum</p>
<p class="p1">level of service” and specify the levels of availability, serviceability, performance, operation, or other</p>
<p class="p1">attributes of the service, such as billing. Penaltiesmay also be specified in the case of noncompliance with</p>
<p class="p1">the SLA. It is expected that any service-oriented architecture (SOA) will eventually include middleware</p>
<p class="p1">supporting SLAmanagement. The <span class="s1">Framework 7 </span>project supported by the European Union is researching</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">this area (see </span>http://sla-at-soi.eu/<span class="s3">).</span></p>
<p class="p1">The commonmetrics specified by an SLA are service-specific. For example, themetrics used by a <span class="s1">call</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">center </span>usually are: (i) abandonment rate: percentage of calls abandoned while waiting to be answered;</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) average speed to answer: average time before the service desk answers a call; (iii) time service factor:</p>
<p class="p1">percentage of calls answered within a definite time frame; (iv) first-call resolution: percentage of incoming</p>
<p class="p1">calls that can be resolved without a callback; and (v) turnaround time: time to complete a certain task.</p>
<p class="p1">There are two well-differentiated phases in SLA management: the negotiation of the contract and</p>
<p class="p1">the monitoring of its fulfillment in real time. In turn, automated negotiation has three main components:</p>
<p class="p1">(i) the <span class="s1">object of negotiation</span>, which defines the attributes and constraints under negotiation; (ii) the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">negotiation protocols</span>, which describe the interaction between negotiating parties; and (iii) the <span class="s1">decision</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">models </span>responsible for processing proposals and generating counterproposals.</p>
<p class="p1">The concept of compliance in cloud computing is discussed in [<span class="s4">55</span>] in the context of the user’s</p>
<p class="p1">ability to select a provider of service. The selection process is subject to customizable compliance with</p>
<p class="p1">user requirements, such as security, deadlines, and costs. The authors propose an infrastructure called</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compliant Cloud Computing </span>(C3) consisting of: (i) a language to express user requirements and the</p>
<p class="p1">compliance level agreements (CLAs) and (ii) the middleware for managing CLAs.</p>
<p class="p1">The Web Service Agreement Specification (WS-Agreement) [<span class="s4">20</span>] uses an XML-based language</p>
<p class="p1">to define a protocol for creating an agreement using a predefined template with some customizable</p>
<p class="p1">aspects. It only supports one-round negotiation without counterproposals. A policy-based framework</p>
<p class="p1">for automated SLA negotiation for a virtual computing environment is described in [<span class="s4">379</span>].</p>
