<p class="p1">In this chapter we give an overview of the cloud computing infrastructure at Amazon, Google, and</p>
<p class="p1">Microsoft as ofmid-2012. These cloud service providers support one or more of the three cloud computing</p>
<p class="p1">delivery models discussed in Section 1.4: <span class="s1">Infrastructure-as-a-Service </span>(IaaS), <span class="s1">Platform-as-a-Service</span></p>
<p class="p1">(PaaS), and <span class="s1">Software-as-a-Service </span>(SaaS). Amazon is a pioneer in <span class="s1">IaaS</span>, Google’s efforts are focused</p>
<p class="p1">on <span class="s1">SaaS </span>and <span class="s1">PaaS </span>delivery models, and Microsoft is involved in <span class="s1">PaaS</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Private clouds are an alternative to public clouds. Open-source cloud computing platforms such as</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eucalyptus </span>[<span class="s2">269</span>], <span class="s1">OpenNebula</span>, <span class="s1">Nimbus</span>, and <span class="s1">OpenStack </span>can be used as a control infrastructure for</p>
<p class="p1">a private cloud. We continue our discussion of the cloud infrastructure with an overview of service</p>
<p class="p1">level agreements (SLAs) and the responsibility sharing between users and cloud service providers,</p>
<p class="p1">followed by a brief discussion of software licensing, energy consumption, and ecological impact of</p>
<p class="p1">cloud computing. We conclude with a section covering user experiences with current systems.</p>
<p class="p1">Several other IT companies are also involved in cloud computing. IBM offers a cloud computing platform,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IBMSmartCloud</span>, which includes servers, storage, and virtualization components for building private</p>
<p class="p1">and hybrid cloud computing environments. In October 2012 it was announced that IBM had teamed</p>
<p class="p1">up with AT&amp;T to give customers access to IBM’s cloud infrastructure over AT&amp;T’s secure private lines.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2011 HP announced plans to enter the cloud computing club. Oracle announced its entry to enterprise</p>
<p class="p1">computing in the early 2012. The Oracle Cloud is based on Java, SQL standards, and software</p>
<p class="p1">systems such as Exadata, Exalogic, WebLogic, and Oracle Database. Oracle plans to offer application</p>
<p class="p1">and platform services. Some of these services are Fusion HCM (Human Capital Management), Fusion</p>
<p class="p1">CRM (Customer Relation Management), and Oracle Social Network; the platform services are based</p>
<p class="p1">on Java and SQL.</p>
