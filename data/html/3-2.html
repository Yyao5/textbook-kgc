<p class="p1">Google’s effort is concentrated in the area of <span class="s1">Software-as-a-Service </span>(SaaS). It is estimated that the</p>
<p class="p1">number of servers used by Google was close to 1<span class="s1">.</span>8 million in January 2012 and was expected to reach</p>
<p class="p1">close to 2<span class="s1">.</span>4 million in early 2013 [<span class="s2">289</span>].</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Services such as </span>Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Picasa<span class="s3">, and </span>Google Groups <span class="s3">are free of</span></p>
<p class="p1">charge for individual users and available for a fee for organizations. These services are running on a cloud</p>
<p class="p1">and can be invoked from a broad spectrum of devices, including mobile ones such as iPhones, iPads,</p>
<p class="p1">Black-Berrys, and laptops and tablets. The data for these services is stored in data centers on the cloud.</p>
<p class="p1">The <span class="s1">Gmail </span>service hosts emails on Google servers and, provides aWeb interface to access them and</p>
<p class="p1">tools for migrating from Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange. <span class="s1">Google Docs </span>is Web-based software</p>
<p class="p1">for building text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. It supports features such as tables, bullet</p>
<p class="p1">points, basic fonts, and text size; it allows multiple users to edit and update the same document and view</p>
<p class="p1">the history of document changes; and it provides a spell checker. The service allows users to import and</p>
<p class="p1">export files in several formats, including Microsoft Office, PDF, text, and OpenOffice extensions.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Google Calendar </span>is a browser-based scheduler; it supports multiple calendars for a user, the ability</p>
<p class="p1">to share a calendar with other users, the display of daily/weekly/monthly views, and the ability to search</p>
<p class="p1">events and synchronize with the Outlook Calendar. Google Calendar is accessible from mobile devices.</p>
<p class="p1">Event reminders can be received via SMS, desktop popups, or emails. It is also possible to share your</p>
<p class="p1">calendar with other Google Calendar users. <span class="s1">Picasa </span>is a tool to upload, share, and edit images; it provides</p>
<p class="p1">1 GB of disk space per user free of charge. Users can add tags to images and attach locations to photos using <span class="s1">Google Maps</span>. <span class="s1">Google Groups </span>allows users to host discussion forums to create messages online</p>
<p class="p1">or via email.</p>
<p class="p1">Google is also a leader in the <span class="s1">Platform-as-a-Service </span>(PaaS) space. AppEngine is a developer platform</p>
<p class="p1">hosted on the cloud. Initially it supported only Python, but support for Java was added later and detailed</p>
<p class="p1">documentation for Java is available. The database for code development can be accessed with Google</p>
<p class="p1">Query Language (GQL) with a SQL-like syntax.</p>
<p class="p1">The concept of <span class="s1">structured data </span>is important to Google’s service strategy. The change of search</p>
<p class="p1">philosophy reflects the transition from unstructured Web content to structured data, data that contains</p>
<p class="p1">additional information, such as the place where a photograph was taken, information about the singer</p>
<p class="p1">of a digital recording of a song, the local services at a geographic location, and so on [<span class="s2">227</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Search engine crawlers rely on hyperlinks to discover new content. The <span class="s1">deep Web </span>is content stored</p>
<p class="p1">in databases and served as pages created dynamically by querying HTML forms. Such content is</p>
<p class="p1">unavailable to crawlers that are unable to fill out such forms. Examples of <span class="s1">deep Web </span>sources are sites</p>
<p class="p1">with geographic-specific information, such as local stores, services, and businesses; sites that report</p>
<p class="p1">statistics and analysis produced by governmental and nongovernmental organizations; art collections;</p>
<p class="p1">photo galleries; bus, train, and airline schedules; and so on. Structured content is created by labeling;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Flickr </span>and <span class="s1">Google Co-op </span>are examples of structures where labels and annotations are added to objects,</p>
<p class="p1">images, and pages stored on the Web.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Google Co-op </span>allows users to create customized search engines based on a set of <span class="s1">facets </span>or categories.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, the facets for a search engine for the database research community available at</p>
<p class="p3">http://data.cs.washington.edu/coop/dbresearch/index.html <span class="s4">are </span><span class="s5">professor</span><span class="s4">, </span><span class="s5">project</span><span class="s4">,</span></p>
<p class="p4">publication<span class="s3">, </span>jobs<span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Google Base </span>is a service allowing users to load structured data from different sources to a central</p>
<p class="p1">repository that is a very large, self-describing, semi-structured, heterogeneous database. It is selfdescribing</p>
<p class="p1">because each item follows a simple schema: (item type, attribute names). Few users are</p>
<p class="p1">aware of this service. <span class="s1">Google Base </span>is accessed in response to keyword queries posed on <span class="s1">Google.com</span>,</p>
<p class="p1">provided that there is relevant data in the database. To fully integrate Google Base, the results should</p>
<p class="p1">be ranked across properties. In addition, the service needs to propose appropriate refinements with</p>
<p class="p1">candidate values in select menus; this is done by computing histograms on attributes and their values</p>
<p class="p1">during query time.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Google Drive </span>is an online service for data storage that has been available since April 2012. It gives</p>
<p class="p1">users 5 GB of free storage and charges $4 per month for 20 GB. It is available for PCs, MacBooks,</p>
<p class="p1">iPhones, iPads, and Android devices and allows organizations to purchase up to 16 TB of storage.</p>
<p class="p1">Specialized structure-aware search engines for several interest areas, including travel, weather, and</p>
<p class="p1">local services, have already been implemented. However, the data available on theWeb covers a wealth</p>
<p class="p1">of human knowledge; it is not feasible to define all the possible domains and it is nearly impossible to</p>
<p class="p1">decide where one domain ends and another begins.</p>
<p class="p1">Google has also redefined the laptop with the introduction of the <span class="s1">Chromebook</span>, a purelyWeb-centric</p>
<p class="p1">device running <span class="s1">Chrome OS</span>. Cloud-based applications, extreme portability, built-in <span class="s1">3G </span>connectivity,</p>
<p class="p1">almost instant-on, and all-day battery life are the main attractions of this device with a keyboard.</p>
<p class="p1">Google adheres to a bottom-up, engineer-driven, liberal licensing and user application development</p>
<p class="p1">philosophy, whereas Apple, a recent entry in cloud computing, tightly controls the technology stack, builds its own hardware, and requires application developers to follow strict rules. Apple products,</p>
<p class="p1">including the iPhone, the iOS, the iTunes Store, <span class="s1">Mac OS X</span>, and iCloud, offer unparalleled polish and</p>
<p class="p1">effortless interoperability, but the flexibility of Google results in more cumbersome user interfaces for</p>
<p class="p1">the broad spectrum of devices running the Android OS.</p>
<p class="p1">Google as well as the other cloud service providers must manage vast amounts of data. In a world</p>
<p class="p1">where users would most likely desire to use multiple cloud services from independent providers, the</p>
<p class="p1">question of whether the traditional data base management services (DBMSs) are sufficient to ensure</p>
<p class="p1">interoperability comes to mind. A DBMS efficiently supports data manipulations and query processing</p>
<p class="p1">but operates in a single administrative domain and uses well-defined schema. The interoperability of data</p>
<p class="p1">management services requires <span class="s1">semantic integration </span>of services based on different schemas. An answer</p>
<p class="p1">to the limitations of traditional DBMS is the so-called <span class="s1">dataspaces </span>introduced in [<span class="s2">127</span>]; dataspaces do</p>
<p class="p1">not aim at data integration but rather at data coexistence.</p>
