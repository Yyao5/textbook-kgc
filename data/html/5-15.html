<p class="p1">Virtual memory was the first application of virtualization concepts to commercial computers. It allowed</p>
<p class="p1">multiprogramming and eliminated the need for users to tailor their applications to the physical memory</p>
<p class="p1">available on individual systems. Paging and segmentation are the two mechanisms supporting virtual</p>
<p class="p1">memory. Paging was developed for the Atlas Computer, built in 1959 at the University of Manchester.</p>
<p class="p1">Independently, the Burroughs Corporation developed the B5000, the first commercial computer with virtual memory, and released it in 1961. The virtual memory of the B5000 used segmentation rather</p>
<p class="p1">than paging.</p>
<p class="p1">In 1967 IBM introduced the 360/67, the first IBM system with virtual memory, expected to run</p>
<p class="p1">on a new operating system called TSS. Before TSS was released, an operating system called CP-67</p>
<p class="p1">was created. CP-67 gave the illusion of several standard IBM 360 systems without virtual memory.</p>
<p class="p1">The first VMM supporting full virtualization was the CP-40 system, which ran on a S/360-40 that was</p>
<p class="p1">modified at the IBMCambridge Scientific Center to supportDynamic Address Translation, a key feature</p>
<p class="p1">that allowed virtualization. In CP-40, the hardware’s supervisor state was virtualized as well, allowing</p>
<p class="p1">multiple operating systems to run concurrently in separate virtual machine contexts.</p>
<p class="p1">In this early age of computing, virtualization was driven by the need to share very expensive hardware</p>
<p class="p1">among a large population of users and applications. The VM/370 system, released in 1972 for large IBM</p>
<p class="p1">mainframes, was very successful. It was based on a reimplementation of CP/CMS. In the VM/370 a new</p>
<p class="p1">virtual machine was created for every user, and this virtual machine interacted with the applications.</p>
<p class="p1">The VMM managed hardware resources and enforced the multiplexing of resources. Modern-day IBM</p>
<p class="p1">mainframes, such as the zSeries line, retain backward compatibility with the 1960s-era IBM S/360 line.</p>
<p class="p1">The production of microprocessors, coupled with advancements in storage technology, contributed</p>
<p class="p1">to the rapid decrease of hardware costs and led to the introduction of personal computers at one end of</p>
<p class="p1">the spectrum and large mainframes and massively parallel systems at the other end. The hardware and</p>
<p class="p1">the operating systems of the 1980s and 1990s gradually limited virtualization and focused instead on</p>
<p class="p1">efficient multitasking, user interfaces, the support for networking, and security problems brought in by</p>
<p class="p1">interconnectivity.</p>
<p class="p1">The advancements in computer and communication hardware and the explosion of the Internet, partially</p>
<p class="p1">due to the success of theWorldWideWeb at the end of the 1990s, renewed interest in virtualization</p>
<p class="p1">to support server security and isolation of services. In their review paper, Rosenbloom and Grafinkel write</p>
<p class="p1">[<span class="s1">308</span>]: “VMMs give operating system developers another opportunity to develop functionality no longer</p>
<p class="p1">practical in today’s complex and ossified operating systems, where innovation moves at a geologic pace.”</p>
