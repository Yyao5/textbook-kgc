<p class="p1">Cloud computing and delivery of content stored on a cloud are feasible only due to the interconnectivity</p>
<p class="p1">supported by a continually evolving Internet and by the access to remote resources provided by theWorld</p>
<p class="p1">WideWeb. A cloud is built around a high-performance interconnect; the servers in a cloud communicate</p>
<p class="p1">through high-bandwidth and low-latency specialized networks. It is thus obvious why networking will</p>
<p class="p1">continue to play a crucial role in the evolution of cloud computing and a content-centric world.</p>
<p class="p1">This chapter starts with a review of basic concepts related to packet switching and the Internet in</p>
<p class="p1">Sections <span class="s1">7.1 </span>and <span class="s1">7.2</span>. The need to accommodate a very large address space is discussed in Section <span class="s1">7.3</span>;</p>
<p class="p1">then the transformational changes suffered by the Internet under the pressure of applications are surveyed</p>
<p class="p1">in Section <span class="s1">7.4</span>. Section <span class="s1">7.5 </span>covers statistics regarding Web metrics and the arguments for increasing</p>
<p class="p1">the initial congestion control window in TCP. Models for network resource management are analyzed</p>
<p class="p1">in Section <span class="s1">7.6</span>. Efficient topologies for computer clouds and storage area networks are discussed in</p>
<p class="p1">Sections <span class="s1">7.7 </span>and <span class="s1">7.8</span>, respectively. Overlay networks, small-world networks, and scale-free networks</p>
<p class="p1">are presented in Sections <span class="s1">7.10 </span>and <span class="s1">7.11</span>. Finally, Section <span class="s1">7.12 </span>is devoted to a discussion of epidemic</p>
<p class="p1">algorithms.</p>
