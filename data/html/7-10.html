<p class="p1">An <span class="s1">overlay network</span>, or virtual network, is a network built on top of a physical network. The nodes of an</p>
<p class="p1">overlay network are connected by virtual links that can traverse multiple physical links.Overlay networks</p>
<p class="p1">are widely used in many distributed systems such as peer-to-peer systems, content-delivery systems,</p>
<p class="p1">and client-server systems; in all these cases the distributed systems communicate through the Internet.</p>
<p class="p1">An overlay network can support QoS guarantees for data-streaming applications through improved</p>
<p class="p1">routing over the Internet. It can also support routing of messages to destinations not specified by an</p>
<p class="p1">IP address; in this case, distributed hash tables can be used to route messages based on their logical</p>
<p class="p1">addresses. For example, <span class="s1">Akamai </span>is a company that manages an overlay network to provide reliable and</p>
<p class="p1">efficient content delivery.</p>
<p class="p1">Virtualization is a central concept in cloud computing. We have discussed extensively the virtualization</p>
<p class="p1">of processors, and it makes sense to consider also the virtualization of the cloud interconnect.</p>
<p class="p1">Indeed, communication is a critical function of a cloud, and overlay networks can be used to support</p>
<p class="p1">more efficient resource management. In this section we discuss several possible candidates as virtual</p>
<p class="p1">cloud interconnects and algorithms to construct such networks. Such networks are modeled as graphs;</p>
<p class="p1">we start our discussion with a few concepts from graph theory.</p>
<p class="p1">The topology of a network used to model the interactions in complex biological, social, economic, and</p>
<p class="p1">computing systems is described by means of graphs in which vertices represent the entities and the edges</p>
<p class="p1">represent their interactions. The number of edges incident upon a vertex is called the <span class="s1">degree of the vertex</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Several types of graphs have been investigated, starting with the Erd s-R ny model [<span class="s2">53</span>,<span class="s2">116</span>,<span class="s2">117</span>], in</p>
<p class="p1">which the number of vertices is fixed and the edges connecting vertices are created randomly. Thismodel</p>
<p class="p1">produces a homogeneous network with an exponential tail, and connectivity follows a Poisson distribution</p>
<p class="p1">peaked at the average degree <span class="s1">  k </span>and decaying exponentially for <span class="s1">k     k</span>. An evolving network, in</p>
<p class="p1">which the number of vertices increases linearly and a newly introduced vertex is connected to <span class="s1">m </span>existing</p>
<p class="p1">vertices according to a preferential attachment rule, is described by Barab si and Albert in [<span class="s2">10 </span>– <span class="s2">12</span>,<span class="s2">39</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Regular graphs in which a fraction of edges are rewired with a probability <span class="s1">p </span>have been proposed</p>
<p class="p1">by Watts and Strogatz and are called <span class="s1">small-world networks </span>[<span class="s2">370</span>]. Networks for which the degree</p>
<p class="p1">distribution follows a power law, <span class="s1">p(k) ∼ k</span><span class="s3">−γ </span>, are called <span class="s1">scale-free networks</span>. The four models are</p>
<p class="p1">sometimes referred to as Erd s-R ny (ER), Barab si-Albert (BA),Watts-Strogatz (WS), and Scale-free</p>
<p class="p1">(SF) models, respectively [<span class="s2">140</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Small-World Networks. Traditionally, the connection topology of a network was assumed to be</p>
<p class="p1">either completely regular or completely random. Regular graphs are highly clustered and have large</p>
<p class="p1">characteristic path length, whereas random graphs exhibit low clustering and have small characteristic</p>
<p class="p1">path length.</p>
<p class="p1">The <span class="s1">characteristic path length, L</span>, is the number of edges in the shortest path between two vertices</p>
<p class="p1">averaged over all pairs of vertices. The <span class="s1">clustering coefficient C </span>is defined as follows: If vertex <span class="s1">a </span>has</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">m</span><span class="s3">a </span>neighbors, then a fully connected network of its neighbors could have at most <span class="s1">E</span><span class="s3">a </span><span class="s1">= m</span><span class="s3">a</span><span class="s1">(m</span><span class="s3">a </span><span class="s1">−</span>1<span class="s1">)/</span>2</p>
<p class="p1">edges. Call <span class="s1">C</span><span class="s3">a </span>the fraction of the <span class="s1">E</span><span class="s3">a </span>edges that actually exist; <span class="s1">C </span>is the average of <span class="s1">C</span><span class="s3">a </span>over all vertices.</p>
<p class="p1">Clearly, <span class="s1">C </span>measures the degree of clusterings of the network.</p>
<p class="p1">In 1998, D. Watts and S. H. Strogatz studied the graphs combining the two desirable features, high</p>
<p class="p1">clustering and small path length, and introduced the Watts-Strogatz graphs [<span class="s2">370</span>]. They proposed the</p>
<p class="p1">following procedure to interpolate between regular and random graphs: Starting from a ring lattice with</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">n </span>vertices and <span class="s1">m </span>edges per node, rewire each edge at random with probability 0 <span class="s1">  p   </span>1; when <span class="s1">p = </span>0</p>
<p class="p1">the graph is regular, and when <span class="s1">p = </span>1 the graph is random.</p>
<p class="p1">When 0 <span class="s1">&lt; p &lt; </span>1, the structural properties of the graph are quantified by:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. </span>The characteristic path length, <span class="s1">L(p)</span>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. </span>The clustering coefficient, <span class="s1">C(p)</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">If the condition</p>
<p class="p2">n   m   <span class="s4">ln </span>(n)   <span class="s4">1 (7.1)</span></p>
<p class="p1">is satisfied, then</p>
<p class="p2">p → <span class="s4">0 </span>⇒ L<span class="s3">regular </span>≈ n/<span class="s4">2</span>m   <span class="s4">1 and </span>C<span class="s3">regular </span>≈ <span class="s4">3</span>/<span class="s4">4</span>, <span class="s4">(7.2)</span></p>
<p class="p1">whereas</p>
<p class="p2">p → <span class="s4">1 </span>⇒ L<span class="s3">random </span>≈ <span class="s4">ln </span>(n)/ <span class="s4">ln </span>(m) <span class="s4">and </span>C<span class="s3">random </span>≈ m/n   <span class="s4">1</span>. <span class="s4">(7.3)</span></p>
<p class="p1">Small-world networks have many vertices with sparse connections but are not in danger of getting</p>
<p class="p1">disconnected. Moreover, there is a broad range of the probability <span class="s1">p </span>such that <span class="s1">L(p) ≈ L</span><span class="s3">random </span>and, at the same time, <span class="s1">C(p)   C</span><span class="s3">random</span>. The significant drop of <span class="s1">L(p) </span>is caused by the introduction of a few</p>
<p class="p1">shortcuts that connect vertices that otherwise would be much further apart. For small <span class="s1">p</span>, the addition of</p>
<p class="p1">a shortcut has a highly nonlinear effect; it affects not only the distance between the pair of vertices it</p>
<p class="p1">connects but also the distance between their neighbors. If the shortcut replaces an edge in a clustered</p>
<p class="p1">neighborhood, <span class="s1">C(p) </span>remains practically unchanged, because it is a linear function of <span class="s1">m</span>.</p>
