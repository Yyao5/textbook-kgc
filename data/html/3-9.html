<p class="p1">After reviewing cloud services provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, we are in a better</p>
<p class="p1">position to understand the differences among <span class="s1">SaaS</span>, <span class="s1">IaaS</span>, and <span class="s1">PaaS</span>. There is no confusion about <span class="s1">SaaS</span>;</p>
<p class="p1">the service provider supplies both the hardware and the application software, and the user has direct</p>
<p class="p1">access to these services through aWeb interface and has no control over cloud resources. Typical examples</p>
<p class="p1">are Google with Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Groups, and Picasa and Microsoft</p>
<p class="p1">with the Online Services.</p>
<p class="p1">In the case of <span class="s1">IaaS</span>, the service provider supplies the hardware (servers, storage, networks) and</p>
<p class="p1">system software (operating systems, databases); in addition, the provider ensures system attributes such</p>
<p class="p1">as security, fault tolerance, and load balancing. The representative of <span class="s1">IaaS </span>is Amazon <span class="s1">AWS</span>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PaaS </span>provides only a platform, including the hardware and system software, such as operating systems</p>
<p class="p1">and databases; the service provider is responsible for system updates, patches, and software maintenance.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PaaS </span>does not allow any user control of the operating system, security features, or the ability to install</p>
<p class="p1">applications. Typical examples are <span class="s1">Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure</span>, and <span class="s2">Force.com</span>, provided by</p>
<p class="p2">Salesforce.com<span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The level of user control over the system in <span class="s1">IaaS </span>is different form <span class="s1">PaaS</span>. <span class="s1">IaaS </span>provides total control,</p>
<p class="p1">whereas <span class="s1">PaaS </span>typically provides no control. Consequently, <span class="s1">IaaS </span>incurs administration costs similar to</p>
<p class="p1">a traditional computing infrastructure, whereas the administrative costs are virtually zero for <span class="s1">PaaS</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">It is critical for a cloud user to carefully <span class="s4">read </span>the SLA and to understand the limitations of the</p>
<p class="p1">liability a cloud provider is willing to accept. In many instances the liabilities do not apply to damages</p>
<p class="p1">caused by a third party or to failures attributed either to the customerâ€™s hardware and software or to</p>
<p class="p1">hardware and software from a third party.</p>
<p class="p1">The limits of responsibility between the cloud user and the cloud service provider are different for</p>
<p class="p1">the three service-delivery models, as we can see in Figure <span class="s5">3.7</span>. In the case of <span class="s1">SaaS </span>the user is partially</p>
<p class="p1">responsible for the interface; the user responsibility increases in the case of <span class="s1">PaaS </span>and includes the</p>
<p class="p1">interface and the application. In the case of <span class="s1">IaaS </span>the user is responsible for all the events occurring in</p>
<p class="p1">the virtual machine running the application.</p>
<p class="p1">For example, if a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) causes the entire <span class="s1">IaaS </span>infrastructure to</p>
<p class="p1">fail, the cloud service provider is responsible for the consequences of the attack. The user is responsible</p>
<p class="p1">if the DDoS affects only several instances, including the ones running the user application. A recent</p>
<p class="p1">posting describes the limits of responsibility illustrated in Figure <span class="s5">3.7 </span>and argues that security should be a</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">major concern for </span><span class="s6">IaaS </span><span class="s3">cloud users, (see </span>www.sans.org/cloud/2012/07/19/can-i-outsource-mysecurity-</p>
<p class="p2">to-the-cloud<span class="s3">).</span></p>
