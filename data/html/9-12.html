<p class="p1">The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is an organization with more than 100 corporate members. It aims</p>
<p class="p1">to address all aspects of cloud security and serve as a cloud security standards incubator. The reports,</p>
<p class="p1">available from the organization’s Web site, are periodically updated; the original report was published</p>
<p class="p1">in 2009 [<span class="s1">96</span>] and subsequent reports followed ([<span class="s1">97</span>,<span class="s1">98</span>]).</p>
<p class="p1">A seminal paper on the negative implications of virtualization on system security, “When Virtual</p>
<p class="p1">Is Harder Than Real: Security Challenges in Virtual Machine-Based Computing Environments,” by</p>
<p class="p1">Garfinkel and Rosenblum [<span class="s1">132</span>], was published in 2005, followed by another one that reaches similar</p>
<p class="p1">conclusions [<span class="s1">297</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">A 2010 paper [<span class="s1">147</span>] presents a taxonomy of attacks on computer clouds, and [<span class="s1">101</span>] covers management</p>
<p class="p1">of the security services life cycle. Security issues vary depending on the cloud model, as discussed</p>
<p class="p1">in [<span class="s1">273</span>]. The privacy impact on cloud computing is the topic of [<span class="s1">345</span>]. A 2011 book [<span class="s1">373</span>] gives a comprehensive</p>
<p class="p1">look at cloud security. Privacy and protection of personal data in the European Community</p>
<p class="p1">is discussed in a document available at <span class="s2">ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">One paper [<span class="s1">28</span>] analyzes the inadequacies of current risk controls for a cloud. Intercloud security</p>
<p class="p1">is the theme of [<span class="s1">48</span>]. Secure collaborations are discussed in [<span class="s1">51</span>]. Another paper [<span class="s1">216</span>] presents an</p>
<p class="p1">approach to secure VM execution under untrusted management OS. The social impact of privacy in</p>
<p class="p1">cloud computing is analyzed in [<span class="s1">118</span>]. An anonymous access control scheme is presented in [<span class="s1">182</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">An empirical study into the security exposure to hosts of hostile virtualized environments can be</p>
<p class="p1">found at <span class="s2">taviso.decsystem.org/virtsec.pdf</span>. A model-based security-testing approach to</p>
<p class="p1">cloud computing is presented in [<span class="s1">384</span>]. Several other relevant aspects of security are covered in [<span class="s1">152</span>,</p>
<p class="p2">268<span class="s3">, </span>341<span class="s3">].</span></p>
