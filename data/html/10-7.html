<p class="p1">In addition to the laws of physics, several other factors limit in practice the complexity of man-made</p>
<p class="p1">systems; among them are cost, reliability, performance, and functionality. Assembling reliable systems</p>
<p class="p1">from unreliable components is quite challenging; as the number of components grows, the mean time</p>
<p class="p1">to failure (MTTF) of the entire system becomes smaller and smaller. As the number of components</p>
<p class="p1">increases, so does the complexity of coordination; then the fraction of system resources dedicated to</p>
<p class="p1">coordination increases and limits the performance.</p>
<p class="p1">Modularity allows us to develop individual system components independently and then assemble</p>
<p class="p1">them into more complex structures. Inmany instances the laws of physics place a limit on the composition</p>
<p class="p1">process; for example, the number of gates in a solid-state circuit is limited by the ability to remove the</p>
<p class="p1">heat generated during switching. A new technology could extend these limits until other physical laws,</p>
<p class="p1">e.g., the finite speed of light, expose a new limit.</p>
<p class="p1">Computing and communication systems have a unique characteristic: the physical limitations of</p>
<p class="p1">composability can be pushed further and further as the software allows us to overcome the physical</p>
<p class="p1">limitations of the hardware. For example, though there are limits on the number of cores on a chip, the</p>
<p class="p1">software allows us to build multiprocessor systems in which each processor has multiple cores. Such</p>
<p class="p1">systems can then be interconnected using networking hardware under the control of another layer of</p>
<p class="p1">software to form a computer cluster; in turn, multiple clusters can be interconnected to build a computer</p>
<p class="p1">cloud controlled by the next layer of software, and so on.</p>
<p class="p1">Our limited understanding of system complexity and the highly abstract concepts developed in the</p>
<p class="p1">context of natural sciences do not lend themselves to straightforward development of design principles</p>
<p class="p1">for modern computing and communication systems. Nevertheless, the physical nature and the physical</p>
<p class="p1">properties of computing and communication systems must be well understood because the system</p>
<p class="p1">design must obey the laws of physics.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of the specific factors affecting the complexity of computing and communication systems</p>
<p class="p1">are [<span class="s1">2</span>]:</p>
<p class="p1">• The behavior of the systems is controlled by phenomena that occur at multiple scales or levels. As</p>
<p class="p1">levels form or disintegrate, phase transitions and/or chaotic phenomena may occur.</p>
<p class="p1">• Systems have no predefined bottom level; it is never known when a lower-level phenomenon will</p>
<p class="p1">affect how the system works.</p>
<p class="p1">• Abstractions of the system that are useful for a particular aspect of the design may have unwanted</p>
<p class="p1">consequences at another level.</p>
<p class="p1">• Systems are entangled with their environment. A system depends on its environment for its persistence;</p>
<p class="p1">therefore, it is far from equilibrium. The environment is man-made and the selection required</p>
<p class="p1">by the evolution can either result in innovation or generate unintended consequences, or both.</p>
<p class="p1">• Systems are expected to function simultaneously as individual systems and as groups of systems</p>
<p class="p1">(systems of systems).</p>
<p class="p1">• Typically, computing and communication systems are both deployed and under development at the</p>
<p class="p1">same time.</p>
<p class="p1">A number of factors contribute to the complexity of modern computing and communication systems,</p>
<p class="p1">as shown in Figure <span class="s1">10.1</span>. Some of these factors are:</p>
<p class="p1">• The rapid pace of technological developments and the availability of relatively cheap and efficient</p>
<p class="p1">new system components such as multicore processors, sensors, retina displays, and high-density</p>
<p class="p1">storage devices.</p>
<p class="p1">• The development of new applications that take advantage of the new technological developments.</p>
<p class="p1">• The ubiquitous use of the systems in virtually every area of human endeavor, which, in turn, demands</p>
<p class="p1">a faster pace for hardware and software development.</p>
<p class="p1">• The need for interconnectivity and the support for mobility.</p>
<p class="p1">• The need to optimize the resource consumption.</p>
<p class="p1">• The constraints imposed by the laws of physics, such as heat dissipation and finite speed of light.</p>
<p class="p1">Each one of these factors could have side effects. For example, the very large number of transistors</p>
<p class="p1">on a chip allows hiding of <span class="s2">hardware trojan horses (HTH)</span>,<span class="s3">4 </span>malignant circuits that are extremely hard</p>
<p class="p1">to detect. Wireless communication creates new challenges for system security, and increased security</p>
<p class="p1">demands more complex software.</p>
<p class="p1">These factors will continue to demand changes in the way we engineer and manage computing and</p>
<p class="p1">communication systems. They may require paradigm shifts in many areas, including hardware design,</p>
<p class="p1">software engineering, and new strategies for systems integration.</p>
