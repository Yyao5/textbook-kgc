<p class="p1">Two theoretical developments in the 1930s were critical in the development of modern computers. The</p>
<p class="p1">first was the publication of Alan Turing’s 1936 paper [<span class="s1">354</span>] that provided a definition of a universal</p>
<p class="p1">computer, called a Turing machine, which executes a program stored on tape. The paper also proved that</p>
<p class="p1">there were problems, such as the halting problem, that could not be solved by any sequential process.</p>
<p class="p1">The second major development was the publication in 1937 of Claude Shannon’smaster’s thesis at MIT,</p>
<p class="p1">“A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,” in which he showed that any Boolean logic</p>
<p class="p1">expression can be implemented using logic gates.</p>
<p class="p1">The first Turing complete<span class="s2">8 </span>computing devicewas the <span class="s3">Z3</span>, an electromechanical device built byKonrad</p>
<p class="p1">Zuse in Germany in May 1941. The <span class="s3">Z3 </span>used a binary floating-point representation of numbers and was</p>
<p class="p1">program-controlled by film stock. The first programmable electronic computer, the <span class="s3">ENIAC</span>, built at the</p>
<p class="p1">Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania by a team led by John Prosper Eckart and John Mauchly, became operational in July 1946 [<span class="s1">239</span>]. Unlike the <span class="s3">Z3</span>, the <span class="s3">ENIAC </span>used a</p>
<p class="p1">decimal number system and was program-controlled by patch cables and switches.</p>
<p class="p1">John von Neumann, the famous mathematician and theoretical physicist, contributed fundamental</p>
<p class="p1">ideas for modern computers [<span class="s1">60</span>,<span class="s1">362</span>,<span class="s1">363</span>]. His was one of the most brilliant minds of the 20<span class="s4">th </span>century,</p>
<p class="p1">with an uncanny ability to map fuzzy ideas and garbled thoughts to crystal-clear and scientifically</p>
<p class="p1">sound concepts. John von Neumann drew the insight for the stored-program computer from Alan</p>
<p class="p1">Turing’s work<span class="s2">9 </span>and from his visit to University of Pennsylvania; he thought that the <span class="s3">ENIAC </span>was an</p>
<p class="p1">engineering marvel but was less impressed with the awkward manner of “programming” it by manually</p>
<p class="p1">connecting cables and setting switches. He introduced the so-called “von Neumann architecture” in a</p>
<p class="p1">report published in the 1940s; to this day he is faulted by some because he failed to mention in this</p>
<p class="p1">report the sources of his insight.</p>
<p class="p1">Von Neumann led the development at the Institute of Advanced Studies at Princeton of the <span class="s3">MANIAC</span>,</p>
<p class="p1">an acronym for Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Computer. The <span class="s3">MANIAC </span>was closer to</p>
<p class="p1">modern computers than any of its predecessors; it was used for sophisticated calculations required by</p>
<p class="p1">the development of the hydrogen bomb, nicknamed “Ivy Mike” and secretly detonated on November 1,</p>
<p class="p1">1952, over an island that no longer exists in the South Pacific. In a recent book [<span class="s1">110</span>] science historian</p>
<p class="p1">George Dyson writes: “The history of digital computing can be divided into an Old Testament whose</p>
<p class="p1">prophets, led by Leibnitz, supplied the logic, and a New Testament whose prophets led by von Neumann</p>
<p class="p1">built the machines. Alan Turing arrived between them.”</p>
<p class="p1">Third-generation computers were built during the 1964–1971 period; they made extensive use of</p>
<p class="p1">integrated circuits (ICs) and ran under the control of operating systems. <span class="s3">MULTIX </span>(Multiplexed Information</p>
<p class="p1">and Computing Service) was an early time-sharing operating system for the GE 645 mainframe,</p>
<p class="p1">developed jointly by MIT, GE, and Bell Labs [<span class="s1">91</span>]. It had numerous novel features and implemented</p>
<p class="p1">a fair number of interesting concepts, such as a hierarchical file system, access control lists for file</p>
<p class="p1">information sharing, dynamic linking, and online reconfiguration.</p>
<p class="p1">The development of the <span class="s3">UNIX </span>system was a consequence of the withdrawal of Bell Labs from the</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">MULTIX </span>project in 1968. <span class="s3">UNIX </span>was developed in 1969 for a DEC PDP minicomputer by a group led</p>
<p class="p1">by Kenneth Thompson and Dennis Ritchie [<span class="s1">304</span>]. According to [<span class="s1">303</span>], “the most important job of <span class="s3">UNIX</span></p>
<p class="p1">is to provide a file-system.” The same reference discusses another concept introduced by the system:</p>
<p class="p1">“For most users, communication with <span class="s3">UNIX </span>is carried on with the aid of a program called the Shell.</p>
<p class="p1">The Shell is a command line interpreter: it reads lines typed by the user and interprets them as requests</p>
<p class="p1">to execute other programs.”</p>
<p class="p1">The firstmicroprocessor, the Intel 4004, announced in 1971, performed binary-coded decimal (BCD)</p>
<p class="p1">arithmetic using 4-bit words. It was followed in 1971 by the Intel 8080, the first 8-bit microprocessor,</p>
<p class="p1">and by its competitor, Motorola 6800, released in 1974. The first 16-bit multichip microprocessor, the</p>
<p class="p1">IMP-16, was announced in 1973 by National Semiconductor. The 32-bit microprocessors appeared in</p>
<p class="p1">1979; the widely used Motorola MC68000 had 32-bit registers and supported 24-bit addressing. Intel’s</p>
<p class="p1">80286 was introduced in 1982. The 64-bit processor era was inaugurated by the AMD64, an architecture</p>
<p class="p1">called <span class="s3">x86</span>-64, backward-compatible with Intel <span class="s3">x86 </span>architecture. Dual-core processors appeared</p>
<p class="p1">in 2005; multicore processors are ubiquitous in today’s servers, PCs, tablets, and even smartphones.</p>
