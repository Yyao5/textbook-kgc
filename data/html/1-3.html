<p class="p1">Once the technological elements were in place, it was only a matter of time until the economical</p>
<p class="p1">advantages of cloud computing became apparent. Due to the economy of scale, large data centers –</p>
<p class="p1">centers with more than 50,000 systems – are more economical to operate than medium-sized centers</p>
<p class="p1">that have around 1,000 systems. Large data centers equipped with commodity computers experience</p>
<p class="p1">a five to seven times decrease of resource consumption, including energy, compared to medium-sized</p>
<p class="p1">centers [<span class="s1">25</span>]. The networking costs, in dollars per Mbit/s/month, are 95<span class="s2">/</span>13 <span class="s2">= </span>7<span class="s2">.</span>1 times larger, and the</p>
<p class="p1">storage costs, in dollars per Gbyte/month, are 2<span class="s2">.</span>2<span class="s2">/</span>0<span class="s2">.</span>4 <span class="s2">= </span>5<span class="s2">.</span>7 times larger for medium-sized centers.</p>
<p class="p1">Medium-sized centers have a larger administrative overhead – one system administrator for 140 systems</p>
<p class="p1">versus one for 1,000 systems for large centers.</p>
<p class="p1">Data centers are very large consumers of electric energy to keep servers and the networking infrastructure</p>
<p class="p1">running and for cooling. For example, there are 6,000 data centers in the United States and in</p>
<p class="p1">2006 they reportedly consumed 61 billion KWh, 1.5% of all electric energy in the U.S., at a cost of</p>
<p class="p1">$4.5 billion. The power demanded by data centers was predicted to double from 2006 to 2011. Peak</p>
<p class="p1">instantaneous demand was predicted to increase from 7 GW in 2006 to 12 GW in 2011, requiring the</p>
<p class="p1">construction of 10 new power plants. In the United States the energy costs differ from state to state;</p>
<p class="p1">for example 1 KWh costs 3.6 cents in Idaho, 10 cents in California, and 18 cents in Hawaii. Thus, data</p>
<p class="p1">centers should be placed at sites with low energy cost.</p>
<p class="p1">The term <span class="s2">computer cloud </span>is overloaded, since it covers infrastructures of different sizes,with different</p>
<p class="p1">management and different user populations. Several types of cloud are envisioned:</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Private cloud. </span>The infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the</p>
<p class="p1">organization or a third party and may exist on or off the premises of the organization.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Community cloud. </span>The infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific</p>
<p class="p1">community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance</p>
<p class="p1">considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises</p>
<p class="p1">or off premises.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Public cloud. </span>The infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group</p>
<p class="p1">and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Hybrid cloud. </span>The infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or</p>
<p class="p1">public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology</p>
<p class="p1">that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).</p>
<p class="p1">A private cloud could provide the computing resources needed for a large organization, such as a</p>
<p class="p1">research institution, a university, or a corporation. The argument that a private cloud does not support</p>
<p class="p1">utility computing is based on the observation that an organization has to invest in the infrastructure and</p>
<p class="p1">a user of a private cloud pays as it consumes resources [<span class="s1">25</span>]. Nevertheless, a private cloud could use the same hardware infrastructure as a public one; its security requirements will be different from those for</p>
<p class="p1">a public cloud and the software running on the cloud is likely to be restricted to a specific domain.</p>
<p class="p1">A natural question to ask is: Why could cloud computing be successful when other paradigms</p>
<p class="p1">have failed? The reasons that cloud computing could be successful can be grouped into several general</p>
<p class="p1">categories: technological advances, a realistic system model, user convenience, and financial advantages.</p>
<p class="p1">A nonexhaustive list of reasons for the success of cloud computing includes these points:</p>
<p class="p1">• Cloud computing is in a better position to exploit recent advances in software, networking, storage,</p>
<p class="p1">and processor technologies. Cloud computing is promoted by large IT companies where these new</p>
<p class="p1">technological developments take place, and these companies have a vested interest in promoting the</p>
<p class="p1">new technologies.</p>
<p class="p1">• A cloud consists of a homogeneous set of hardware and software resources in a single administrative</p>
<p class="p1">domain. In this setup, security, resource management, fault tolerance, and quality of service are less</p>
<p class="p1">challenging than in a heterogeneous environment with resources in multiple administrative domains.</p>
<p class="p1">• Cloud computing is focused on enterprise computing; its adoption by industrial organizations, financial</p>
<p class="p1">institutions, healthcare organizations, and so on has a potentially huge impact on the economy.</p>
<p class="p1">• Acloud provides the illusion of infinite computing resources; its elasticity frees application designers</p>
<p class="p1">from the confinement of a single system.</p>
<p class="p1">• A cloud eliminates the need for up-front financial commitment, and it is based on a pay-as-you-go</p>
<p class="p1">approach. This has the potential to attract new applications and new users for existing applications,</p>
<p class="p1">fomenting a new era of industrywide technological advancements.</p>
<p class="p1">In spite of the technological breakthroughs that have made cloud computing feasible, there are still</p>
<p class="p1">major obstacles for this new technology; these obstacles provide opportunity for research.We list a few</p>
<p class="p1">of the most obvious obstacles:</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Availability of service. </span>What happens when the service provider cannot deliver? Can a large company</p>
<p class="p1">such as General Motors move its IT to the cloud and have assurances that its activity will not be</p>
<p class="p1">negatively affected by cloud overload? A partial answer to this question is provided by service-level</p>
<p class="p1">agreements (SLAs).<span class="s3">6 </span>A temporary fix with negative economical implications is <span class="s2">overprovisioning</span>,</p>
<p class="p1">that is, having enough resources to satisfy the largest projected demand.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Vendor lock-in. </span>Once a customer is hooked to one provider, it is hard to move to another. The</p>
<p class="p1">standardization efforts at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) attempt to address</p>
<p class="p1">this problem.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Data confidentiality and auditability. </span>This is indeed a serious problem; we analyze it in Chapter 9.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Data transfer bottlenecks. </span>Many applications are data-intensive. A very important strategy is to store</p>
<p class="p1">the data as close as possible to the site where it is needed. Transferring 1 TB of data on a 1Mbps</p>
<p class="p1">network takes 8 million seconds, or about 10 days; it is faster and cheaper to use courier service</p>
<p class="p1">and send data recoded on some media than to send it over the network. Very high-speed networks</p>
<p class="p1">will alleviate this problem in the future; for example, a 1 Gbps network would reduce this time to</p>
<p class="p1">8,000 s, or slightly more than 2 h.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Performance unpredictability. </span>This is one of the consequences of resource sharing. Strategies for</p>
<p class="p1">performance isolation are discussed in Section 5.5.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4">• </span>Elasticity, the ability to scale up and down quickly. <span class="s4">Newalgorithms for controlling resource allocation</span></p>
<p class="p1">and workload placement are necessary. Autonomic computing based on self-organization and selfmanagement</p>
<p class="p1">seems to be a promising avenue.</p>
<p class="p1">There are other perennial problems with no clear solutions at this time, including software licensing</p>
<p class="p1">and system bugs.</p>
