<p class="p1">Trust in the context of cloud computing is intimately related to the general problem of trust in online</p>
<p class="p1">activities. In this section we first discuss the traditional concept of trust and then the trust necessary to</p>
<p class="p1">online activities.</p>
<p class="p1">According to theMerriam-Webster dictionary, <span class="s1">trust </span>means “assured reliance on the character, ability,</p>
<p class="p1">strength, or truth of someone or something.” Trust is a complex phenomenon; it enables cooperative</p>
<p class="p1">behavior, promotes adaptive organizational forms, reduces harmful conflict, decreases transaction costs,</p>
<p class="p1">facilitates formulation of ad hoc workgroups, and promotes effective responses to crisis [<span class="s2">309</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Two conditions must exist for trust to develop. The first condition is <span class="s1">risk</span>, the perceived probability</p>
<p class="p1">of loss; indeed, trust would not be necessary if there were no risk involved, if there is a certainty that</p>
<p class="p1">an action can succeed. The second condition is <span class="s1">interdependence</span>, the idea that the interests of one entity</p>
<p class="p1">cannot be achieved without reliance on other entities. A trust relationship goes though three phases:</p>
<p class="p1">(1) a building phase, when trust is formed; (2) a stability phase, when trust exists; and (3) a dissolution</p>
<p class="p1">phase, when trust declines.</p>
<p class="p1">There are different reasons for and forms of trust. Utilitarian reasons could be based on the belief that</p>
<p class="p1">the costly penalties for breach of trust exceed any potential benefits from opportunistic behavior. This</p>
<p class="p1">is the essence of <span class="s1">deterrence-based </span>trust. Another reason is the belief that the action involving the other</p>
<p class="p1">party is in the self-interest of that party. This is the so-called <span class="s1">calculus-based </span>trust. After a long sequence</p>
<p class="p1">of interactions, <span class="s1">relational trust </span>between entities can develop based on the accumulated experience of</p>
<p class="p1">dependability and reliance on each other.</p>
<p class="p1">The common wisdom is that an entity must work very hard to build trust but may lose that trust very</p>
<p class="p1">easily; a single violation of trust can lead to irreparable damage. <span class="s1">Persistent trust </span>is trust based on the</p>
<p class="p1">long-term behavior of an entity, whereas <span class="s1">dynamic trust </span>is based on a specific context, e.g., a state of the</p>
<p class="p1">system or the effect of technological developments.</p>
<p class="p1">The trust in the Internet “obscures or lacks entirely the dimensions of character and personality, nature</p>
<p class="p1">of relationship, and institutional character” of traditional trust [<span class="s2">258</span>]. The missing identity, personal</p>
<p class="p1">characteristics, and role definitions are elements we have to deal with in the context of online trust.</p>
<p class="p1">The Internet offers individuals the ability to obscure or conceal their identities. The resulting</p>
<p class="p1">anonymity reduces the cues normally used in judgments of trust. The identity is critical for developing</p>
<p class="p1">trust relations; it allows us to base our trust on the past history of interactions with an entity.</p>
<p class="p1">Anonymity causes mistrust because identity is associated with accountability and, in the absence of</p>
<p class="p1">identity, accountability cannot be enforced. The opacity extends immediately from identity to personal</p>
<p class="p1">characteristics. It is impossible to infer whether the entity or individual we transact with is who it pretends</p>
<p class="p1">to be, since the transactions occur between entities separated in time and distance. Finally, there</p>
<p class="p1">are no guarantees that the entities we transact with fully understand the role they have assumed.</p>
<p class="p1">To remedy the loss of clues, we need security mechanisms for access control, transparency of identity,</p>
<p class="p1">and surveillance. The mechanisms for access control are designed to keep intruders and mischievous</p>
<p class="p1">agents out. Identity transparency requires that the relationship between a virtual agent and a physical</p>
<p class="p1">person should be carefully checked through methods such as biometric identification. Digital signatures</p>
<p class="p1">and digital certificates are used for identification. Surveillance could be based on <span class="s1">intrusion detection </span>or</p>
<p class="p1">on logging and auditing. The first option is based on real-time monitoring, the second on offline sifting</p>
<p class="p1">through audit records.</p>
<p class="p1">Credentials are used when an entity is not known. Credentials are issued by a trusted authority and</p>
<p class="p1">describe the qualities of the entity using the credential. A Doctor of Dental Surgery diploma hanging</p>
<p class="p1">on the wall of a dentist’s office is a credential that the individual has been trained by an accredited</p>
<p class="p1">university and hence is capable of performing a set of dental procedures; similarly, a digital signature</p>
<p class="p1">is a credential used in many distributed applications.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Policies </span>and <span class="s1">reputation </span>are two ways of determining trust. Policies reveal the conditions to obtain</p>
<p class="p1">trust and the actions to take when some of the conditions are met. Policies require the verification of</p>
<p class="p1">credentials.Reputation is a quality attributed to an entity based on a relatively long history of interactions</p>
<p class="p1">with or possibly observations of the entity.Recommendations are based on trust decisions made by others</p>
<p class="p1">and filtered through the perspective of the entity assessing the trust.</p>
<p class="p1">In a computer science context, “trust of a party A to a party B for a service X is the measurable belief</p>
<p class="p1">of A in that B behaves dependably for a specified period within a specified context (in relation to service</p>
<p class="p1">X)” [<span class="s2">272</span>]. An assurance about the operation of a particular hardware or software component leads</p>
<p class="p1">to persistent social-based trust in that component. A comprehensive discussion of trust in computer</p>
<p class="p1">services in the semantic Web can be found in [<span class="s2">26</span>]. In Section 11.10 we discuss the concept of trust in the context of cognitive radio networks where multiple transmitters compete for free communication</p>
<p class="p1">channels. In Section 11.11 we present a cloud-based trust management service.</p>
