<p class="p1">Existing cloud applications can be divided into several broad categories: (i) processing pipelines;</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) batch processing systems; and (iii) Web applications [<span class="s1">360</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Processing pipelines are data-intensive and sometimes compute-intensive applications and represent</p>
<p class="p1">a fairly large segment of applications currently running on the cloud. Several types of data processing</p>
<p class="p1">applications can be identified:</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Indexing</span>. The processing pipeline supports indexing of large datasets created by Web crawler</p>
<p class="p1">engines.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Data mining</span>. The processing pipeline supports searching very large collections of records to locate</p>
<p class="p1">items of interests.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Image processing</span>. A number of companies allow users to store their images on the cloud (e.g., <span class="s2">Flickr</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">(</span><span class="s1">www.flickr.com</span><span class="s3">) and </span><span class="s2">Google </span><span class="s3">(</span><span class="s1">http://picasa.google.com/</span><span class="s3">)). The image-processing</span></p>
<p class="p1">pipelines support image conversion (e.g., enlarging an image or creating thumbnails). They can also</p>
<p class="p1">be used to compress or encrypt images.</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Video transcoding</span>. The processing pipeline transcodes from one video format to another (e.g., from</p>
<p class="p1">AVI to MPEG).</p>
<p class="p1">• <span class="s2">Document processing</span>. The processing pipeline converts very large collections of documents from</p>
<p class="p1">one format to another (e.g., from <span class="s2">Word </span>to <span class="s2">PDF</span>), or encrypts the documents. It could also use optical</p>
<p class="p1">character recognition (OCR) to produce digital images of documents.</p>
<p class="p1">Batch processing systems also cover a broad spectrum of data-intensive applications in enterprise</p>
<p class="p1">computing. Such applications typically have deadlines, and the failure to meet these deadlines could have serious economic consequences. Security is also a critical aspect for many applications of batch</p>
<p class="p1">processing. A nonexhaustive list of batch processing applications includes:</p>
<p class="p1">• Generation of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual activity reports for organizations in retail, manufacturing,</p>
<p class="p1">and other economic sectors.</p>
<p class="p1">• Processing, aggregation, and summaries of daily transactions for financial institutions, insurance</p>
<p class="p1">companies, and healthcare organizations.</p>
<p class="p1">• Inventory management for large corporations.</p>
<p class="p1">• Processing billing and payroll records.</p>
<p class="p1">• Management of the software development (e.g., nightly updates of software repositories).</p>
<p class="p1">• Automatic testing and verification of software and hardware systems.</p>
<p class="p1">Finally, and of increasing importance, are cloud applications in the area of Web access. Several</p>
<p class="p1">categories of Web sites have a periodic or a temporary presence, such as the Web sites for conferences</p>
<p class="p1">or other events. There are also Web sites that are active during a particular season (e.g., the holiday</p>
<p class="p1">season) or that support a particular type of activity, such as income tax reporting with the April 15</p>
<p class="p1">deadline each year. Other limited-time Web sites used for promotional activities “sleep” during the</p>
<p class="p1">night and auto-scale during the day.</p>
<p class="p1">It makes economic sense to store the data in the cloud close to where the application runs; as we saw</p>
<p class="p1">in Section 3.1, the cost per GB is low and the processing is much more efficient when the data is stored</p>
<p class="p1">close to the computational servers. This leads us to believe that several new classes of cloud computing</p>
<p class="p1">applications could emerge in the years to come – for example, batch processing for decision support</p>
<p class="p1">systems and other aspects of business analytics. Another class of new applications could be parallel</p>
<p class="p1">batch processing based on programming abstractions, such as <span class="s2">MapReduce</span>, discussed in Section <span class="s1">4.6</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Mobile interactive applications that process large volumes of data from different types of sensors and</p>
<p class="p1">services that combine more than one data source (e.g., mashups<span class="s4">2</span>) are obvious candidates for cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing.</p>
<p class="p1">Science and engineering could greatly benefit from cloud computing because many applications</p>
<p class="p1">in these areas are compute- and data-intensive. Similarly, a cloud dedicated to education would be</p>
<p class="p1">extremely useful. Mathematical software such as <span class="s2">MATLAB </span>and <span class="s2">Mathematica </span>could also run on the</p>
<p class="p1">cloud.</p>
