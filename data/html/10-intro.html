<p class="p1">This chapter emphasizes the need to adopt a systemic approach to the engineering of modern computing</p>
<p class="p1">and communication systems. Such an approach is critical to the future of large-scale systems such as</p>
<p class="p1">clouds. A systemic approach is also critical to the development of other complex systems such as</p>
<p class="p1">cyberphysical and sociotechnical systems, which are increasingly important in the modern computing</p>
<p class="p1">landscape, along with computer clouds.</p>
<p class="p1">Complex systems exhibit different patterns of behavior than traditional systems and require new</p>
<p class="p1">design principles based on a deeper understanding of the physical properties of their components and</p>
<p class="p1">of the manner in which they interact with one another and with the environment. The new thinking in</p>
<p class="p1">complex system design has to be an ab-initio concern rather than an afterthought.</p>
