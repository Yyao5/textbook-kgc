<p class="p1">“A Brief History of the Internet,” written by Barry Leiner, Vinton Cerf, David Clark, Robert Kahn,</p>
<p class="p1">Leonard Kleinrock, Daniel Lynch, Jon Postel, Larry Roberts, and Stephen Wolff, can be accessed</p>

<p class="p1">The widely used text of Kurose and Ross [<span class="s2">201</span>] is an excellent introduction to basic networking</p>
<p class="p1">concepts. The book by Bertsekas and Gallagher [<span class="s2">50</span>] gives insights into the performance evaluation of</p>
<p class="p1">computer networks. The classic texts on queuing theory of Kleinrock [<span class="s2">195</span>] are required reading for</p>
<p class="p1">those interested in network analysis.</p>
<p class="p1">Moore’s law for traffic is discussed in [<span class="s2">251</span>]. The class-based queuing algorithm was introduced by</p>
<p class="p1">Floyd and Van Jacobson in [<span class="s2">125</span>]. The <span class="s3">Black Widow </span>topology for system interconnects is analyzed in</p>
<p class="p1">[<span class="s2">321</span>]. An extensive treatment of storage area networks can be found in [<span class="s2">347</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Erd s-R ny random graphs are analyzed in [<span class="s2">53</span>,<span class="s2">116</span>]. Scale-free networks and their applications are</p>
<p class="p1">described by Barab si and Albert by [<span class="s2">10 </span>– <span class="s2">12</span>,<span class="s2">39</span>]. Small-world networks were introduced byWatts and</p>
<p class="p1">Strogatz in [<span class="s2">370</span>]. Epidemic algorithms and their applications are presented in [<span class="s2">149</span>,<span class="s2">180</span>,<span class="s2">181</span>]. Additional</p>
<p class="p1">references for the topics covered in this chapter are [<span class="s2">204</span>,<span class="s2">232</span>,<span class="s2">248</span>,<span class="s2">257</span>].</p>
