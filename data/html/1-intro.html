<p class="p1">The last decades have reinforced the idea that information processing can be done more efficiently</p>
<p class="p1">centrally, on large farms of computing and storage systems accessible via the Internet. When computing</p>
<p class="p1">resources in distant data centers are used rather than local computing systems, we talk about</p>
<p class="p2">network-centric computing <span class="s1">and </span>network-centric content<span class="s1">. Advancements in networking and other areas</span></p>
<p class="p1">are responsible for the acceptance of the two new computing models and led to the <span class="s2">grid computing</span></p>
<p class="p1">movement in the early 1990s and, since 2005, to <span class="s2">utility computing </span>and <span class="s2">cloud computing</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">In <span class="s2">utility computing </span>the hardware and software resources are concentrated in large data centers and</p>
<p class="p1">users can pay as they consume computing, storage, and communication resources. Utility computing</p>
<p class="p1">often requires a cloud-like infrastructure, but its focus is on the business model for providing the</p>
<p class="p1">computing services. <span class="s2">Cloud computing </span>is a path to utility computing embraced by major IT companies</p>
<p class="p1">such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and others.</p>
<p class="p1">Cloud computing delivery models, deployment models, defining attributes, resources, and organization</p>
<p class="p1">of the infrastructure discussed in this chapter are summarized in Figure <span class="s3">1.1</span>. There are three cloud</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">delivery models: </span>Software-as-a-Service <span class="s1">(SaaS), </span>Platform-as-a-Service <span class="s1">(PaaS), and </span>Infrastructure-as-a-</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Service </span>(IaaS), deployed as public, private, community, and hybrid clouds.</p>
<p class="p1">The defining attributes of the new philosophy for delivering computing services are as follows:</p>
<p class="p1">• Cloud computing uses Internet technologies to offer elastic services. The term <span class="s2">elastic computing</span></p>
<p class="p1">refers to the ability to dynamically acquire computing resources and support a variable workload. A</p>
<p class="p1">cloud service provider maintains a massive infrastructure to support elastic services.</p>
<p class="p1">• The resources used for these services can be metered and the users can be charged only for the</p>
<p class="p1">resources they use.</p>
<p class="p1">• Maintenance and security are ensured by service providers.</p>
<p class="p1">• Economy of scale allows service providers to operate more efficiently due to specialization and</p>
<p class="p1">centralization.</p>
<p class="p1">• Cloud computing is cost-effective due to resource multiplexing; lower costs for the service provider</p>
<p class="p1">are passed on to the cloud users.</p>
<p class="p1">• The application data is stored closer to the site where it is used in a device- and location-independent</p>
<p class="p1">manner; potentially, this data storage strategy increases reliability and security and, at the same time,</p>
<p class="p1">it lowers communication costs.</p>
<p class="p1">Cloud computing is a technical and social reality and an emerging technology. At this time, one</p>
<p class="p1">can only speculate how the infrastructure for this new paradigm will evolve and what applications will</p>
<p class="p1">migrate to it. The economical, social, ethical, and legal implications of this shift in technology, in which</p>
<p class="p1">users rely on services provided by large data centers and store private data and software on systems</p>
<p class="p1">they do not control, are likely to be significant.</p>
<p class="p1">Scientific and engineering applications, data mining, computational financing, gaming, and social</p>
<p class="p1">networking as well as many other computational and data-intensive activities can benefit from cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing. A broad range of data, from the results of high-energy physics experiments to financial or</p>
<p class="p1">enterprise management data to personal data such as photos, videos, and movies, can be stored on the</p>
<p class="p1">cloud.</p>
<p class="p1">In early 2011 Apple announced the <span class="s2">iCloud, </span>a network-centric alternative for storing content such</p>
<p class="p1">as music, videos, movies, and personal information; this content was previously confined to personal</p>
<p class="p1">devices such as workstations, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. The obvious advantage of networkcentric</p>
<p class="p1">content is the accessibility of information from any site where users can connect to the Internet.</p>
<p class="p1">Clearly, information stored on a cloud can be shared easily, but this approach raises major concerns: Is</p>
<p class="p1">the information safe and secure? Is it accessible when we need it? Do we still own it?</p>
<p class="p1">In the next few years, the focus of cloud computing is expected to shift from building the infrastructure,</p>
<p class="p1">today’s main front of competition among the vendors, to the application domain. This shift in</p>
<p class="p1">focus is reflected by Google’s strategy to build a dedicated cloud for government organizations in the</p>
<p class="p1">United States. The company states: “We recognize that government agencies have unique regulatory</p>
<p class="p1">and compliance requirements for IT systems, and cloud computing is no exception. So we’ve invested</p>
<p class="p1">a lot of time in understanding government’s needs and how they relate to cloud computing.”</p>
<p class="p1">In a discussion of technology trends, noted computer scientist Jim Gray emphasized that in 2003 the</p>
<p class="p1">cost of communication in a wide area network had decreased dramatically and will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="p1">Thus, it makes economical sense to store the data near the application [<span class="s3">144</span>] – in other words, to store</p>
<p class="p1">it in the cloud where the application runs. This insight leads us to believe that several new classes of</p>
<p class="p1">cloud computing applications could emerge in the next few years [<span class="s3">25</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">As always, a good idea has generated a high level of excitement that translated into a flurry of publications</p>
<p class="p1">– some of a scholarly depth, others with little merit or even bursting with misinformation. In this</p>
<p class="p1">book we attempt to sift through the large volume of information and dissect the main ideas related to</p>
<p class="p1">cloud computing. We first discuss applications of cloud computing and then analyze the infrastructure</p>
<p class="p1">for the technology.</p>
<p class="p1">Several decades of research in parallel and distributed computing have paved the way for cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing. Through the years we have discovered the challenges posed by the implementation, as well</p>
<p class="p1">as the algorithmic level, and the ways to address some of them and avoid the others. Thus, it is important</p>
<p class="p1">to look back at the lessons we learned from this experience through the years; for this reason we start</p>
<p class="p1">our discussion with an overview of parallel computing and distributed systems.</p>
