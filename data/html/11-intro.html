<p class="p1">In the previous chapters our discussion was focused on research issues in cloud computing. Now we</p>
<p class="p1">examine computer clouds from the perspective of an application developer. This chapter presents a few</p>
<p class="p1">recipes that are useful in assembling a cloud computing environment on a local system and in using</p>
<p class="p1">basic cloud functions.</p>
<p class="p1">It is fair to assume that the population of application developers and cloud users is and will continue</p>
<p class="p1">to be very diverse. Some cloud users have developed and run parallel applications on clusters or other</p>
<p class="p1">types of systems for many years and expect an easy transition to the cloud. Others are less experienced</p>
<p class="p1">but willing to learn and expect a smooth learning curve. Many view cloud computing as an opportunity</p>
<p class="p1">to develop new businesses with minimum investment in computing equipment and human resources.</p>
<p class="p1">The questions we address here are: How easy is it to use the cloud? How knowledgeable should an</p>
<p class="p1">application developer be about networking and security? How easy is it to port an existing application</p>
<p class="p1">to the cloud? How easy is it to develop a new cloud application?</p>
<p class="p1">The answers to these questions are different for the three cloud delivery models, <span class="s1">SaaS, PaaS</span>, and</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IaaS</span>; the level of difficulty increases as we move toward the base of the cloud service pyramid, as shown</p>
<p class="p1">in Figure <span class="s2">11.1</span>. Recall that <span class="s1">SaaS </span>applications are designed for end users and are accessed over theWeb;</p>
<p class="p1">in this case, users must be familiar with the API of a particular application. <span class="s1">PaaS </span>provides a set of tools</p>
<p class="p1">and services designed to facilitate application coding and deploying; <span class="s1">IaaS </span>provides the hardware and</p>
<p class="p1">the software for servers, storage, and networks, including operating systems and storage management</p>
<p class="p1">software. The <span class="s1">IaaS </span>model poses the most challenges; thus, we restrict our discussion to the <span class="s1">IaaS </span>cloud</p>
<p class="p1">computing model and concentrate on the most popular services offered at this time, the <span class="s1">Amazon Web</span></p>
<p class="p2">Services <span class="s3">(AWS).</span></p>
<p class="p1">Though the <span class="s1">AWS </span>are well documented, the environment they provide for cloud computing requires</p>
<p class="p1">some effort to benefit from the full spectrum of services offered. In this section we report on lessons</p>
<p class="p1">learned from the experience of a group of students with a strong background in programming, networking,</p>
<p class="p1">and operating systems; each of them was asked to develop a cloud application for a problem of</p>
<p class="p1">interest in his or her own research area. Here we first discuss several issues related to cloud security,</p>
<p class="p1">a major stumbling block for many cloud users; then we present a few recipes for the development of</p>
<p class="p1">cloud applications, and finally we analyze several cloud applications developed by individuals in this</p>
<p class="p1">group over a period of less than three months.</p>
<p class="p1">In the second part of this chapter we discuss several applications. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs)</p>
<p class="p1">and a cloud-based simulation of a distributed trust management system are investigated in Section <span class="s2">11.10</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">In Section <span class="s2">11.11 </span>we discuss a cloud service for CRN trust management using a history-based algorithm,</p>
<p class="p1">and we analyze adaptive audio streaming from a cloud in Section <span class="s2">11.12</span>. A cloud-based optimal FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) synthesis with multiple instances running different design options</p>
<p class="p1">is presented in Section <span class="s2">11.13</span>.</p>
