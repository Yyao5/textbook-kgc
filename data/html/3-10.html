<p class="p1">There have been a few studies of user experience based on a large population of cloud computing</p>
<p class="p1">users. An empirical study of the experience of a small group of users of the Finish Cloud Computing Consortium is reported in [<span class="s1">279</span>]. The main user concerns are security threats, the dependence on fast</p>
<p class="p1">Internet connections that forced version updates, data ownership, and user behavior monitoring. All users</p>
<p class="p1">reported that trust in the cloud services is important, two-thirds raised the point of fuzzy boundaries of</p>
<p class="p1">liability between cloud user and provider, about half did not fully comprehend the cloud functions and</p>
<p class="p1">its behavior, and about one-third were concerned about security threats.</p>
<p class="p1">The security threats perceived by this group of users are: (i) abuse and villainous use of the cloud;</p>
<p class="p1">(ii) APIs that are not fully secure; (iii) malicious insiders; (iv) account hijacking; (iv) data leaks; and</p>
<p class="p1">(v) issues related to shared resources. Identity theft and privacy were major concerns for about half of</p>
<p class="p1">the users questioned; availability, liability, and data ownership and copyright were raised by a third of</p>
<p class="p1">respondents.</p>
<p class="p1">The suggested solutions to these problems are as follows: SLAs and tools to monitor usage should</p>
<p class="p1">be deployed to prevent abuse of the cloud; data encryption and security testing should enhance the</p>
<p class="p1">API security; an independent security layer should be added to prevent threats caused by malicious</p>
<p class="p1">insiders; strong authentication and authorization should be enforced to prevent account hijacking; data</p>
<p class="p1">decryption in a secure environment should be implemented to prevent data leakage; and compartmentalization</p>
<p class="p1">of components and firewalls should be deployed to limit the negative effect of resource</p>
<p class="p1">sharing.</p>
<p class="p1">A broad set of concerns identified by the NIST working group on cloud security includes:</p>
<p class="p1">• Potential loss of control/ownership of data.</p>
<p class="p1">• Data integration, privacy enforcement, data encryption.</p>
<p class="p1">• Data remanence after deprovisioning.</p>
<p class="p1">• Multitenant data isolation.</p>
<p class="p1">• Data location requirements within national borders.</p>
<p class="p1">• Hypervisor security.</p>
<p class="p1">• Audit data integrity protection.</p>
<p class="p1">• Verification of subscriber policies through provider controls.</p>
<p class="p1">• Certification/accreditation requirements for a given cloud service.</p>
<p class="p1">A 2010 study conducted by IBM [<span class="s1">176</span>] aims to identify barriers to public and private cloud adoption.</p>
<p class="p1">The study is based on interviews with more than 1<span class="s2">,</span>000 individuals responsible for IT decision making</p>
<p class="p1">around the world. Seventy-seven percent of the respondents cited cost savings as the key argument in</p>
<p class="p1">favor of public cloud adoption, though only 30% of them believed that public clouds are “very appealing</p>
<p class="p1">or appealing” for their line of business, versus 64% for private clouds and 34% for hybrid ones.</p>
<p class="p1">The reasons driving the decision to use public clouds and the percentage of responderswho considered</p>
<p class="p1">each element critical are shown in Table <span class="s1">3.6</span>. In view of the high energy costs for operating a data center</p>
<p class="p1">(discussed in Section <span class="s1">3.7</span>), it seems strange that only 29% of the respondents seem to be concerned</p>
<p class="p1">about lower energy costs.</p>
<p class="p1">The top workloads mentioned by the users involved in this study are data mining and other analytics</p>
<p class="p1">(83%), application streaming (83%), help desk services (80%), industry-specific applications (80%),</p>
<p class="p1">and development environments (80%).</p>
<p class="p1">The study also identified workloads that are not good candidates for migration to a public cloud</p>
<p class="p1">environment:</p>
<p class="p1">• Sensitive data such as employee and health care records.</p>
<p class="p1">• Multiple codependent services (e.g., online transaction processing).</p>
<p class="p1">• Third-party software without cloud licensing.</p>
<p class="p1">• Workloads requiring auditability and accountability.</p>
<p class="p1">• Workloads requiring customization.</p>
<p class="p1">Such studies help identify the concerns of potential cloud users and the critical issues for cloud</p>
<p class="p1">research.</p>
