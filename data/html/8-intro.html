<p class="p1">A cloud provides the vast amounts of storage and computing cycles demanded by many applications.</p>
<p class="p1">The network-centric content model allows a user to access data stored on a cloud from any device connected</p>
<p class="p1">to the Internet. Mobile devices with limited power reserves and local storage take advantage of</p>
<p class="p1">cloud environments to store audio and video files. Clouds provide an ideal environment for multimedia</p>
<p class="p1">content delivery.</p>
<p class="p1">A variety of sources feed a continuous stream of data to cloud applications. An ever-increasing</p>
<p class="p1">number of cloud-based services collect detailed data about their services and information about the</p>
<p class="p1">users of these services. Then the service providers use the clouds to analyze that data.</p>
<p class="p1">Storage and processing on the cloud are intimately tied to one another; indeed, sophisticated strategies</p>
<p class="p1">to reduce the access time and to support real-time multimedia access are necessary to satisfy the</p>
<p class="p1">requirements of content delivery. On the other hand, most cloud applications process very large amounts</p>
<p class="p1">of data; effective data replication and storage management strategies are critical to the computations</p>
<p class="p1">performed on the cloud.</p>
<p class="p1">A new concept, “<span class="s1">big data</span>,” reflects the fact that many applications use data sets so large that they</p>
<p class="p1">cannot be stored and processed using local resources. The consensus is that “big data” growth can</p>
<p class="p1">be viewed as a three-dimensional phenomenon; it implies an increased volume of data, requires an</p>
<p class="p1">increased processing speed to process more data and produce more results, and at the same time it</p>
<p class="p1">involves a diversity of data sources and data types.</p>
<p class="p1">Applications in many areas of science, including genomics, structural biology, high-energy physics,</p>
<p class="p1">astronomy, meteorology, and the study of the environment, carry out complex analysis of data sets,</p>
<p class="p1">often of the order of terabytes.<span class="s2">1 </span>In 2010, the four main detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</p>
<p class="p1">produced 13 PB of data; the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collects about 200 GB of data per night.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result of this increasing appetite for data, file systems such as Btrfs, XFS, ZFS, exFAT, NTFS, HFS</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, and ReFS support disk formats with theoretical volume sizes of several exabytes.</p>
<p class="p1">Several figures can help us place in context the amount of data associated with various human activities.</p>
<p class="p1">The global data volume at the end of 2009 reached 800 EB, according to <span class="s3">www.genevaassociation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">org</span>. Internet video will generate over 18 EB/month in 2013 and global mobile data traffic will</p>
<p class="p1">reach 2 EB/month by 2013 according to a report from Cisco Systems (<span class="s3">www.cisco.com/en/US/</span></p>
<p class="p2">netsol/ns827/networking_solutions_sub_solution.html<span class="s4">).</span></p>
<p class="p1">Our discussion of cloud storage starts with a review of the storage technology in Section <span class="s5">8.1</span>, followed</p>
<p class="p1">by an overview of storage models in Section <span class="s5">8.2</span>. Then we follow the evolution of file systems, from</p>
<p class="p1">distributed to parallel file systems, then to the file systems capable of handling massive amounts of data.</p>
<p class="p1">In Sections <span class="s5">8.3 </span>and <span class="s5">8.4 </span>we discuss distributed file systems,General Parallel File Systems, and theGoogle File System, respectively. A locking service, <span class="s1">Chubby</span>, based on the Paxos algorithm, is presented in</p>
<p class="p1">Section <span class="s5">8.7</span>, followed by a discussion of transaction-processing systems and <span class="s1">NoSQL </span>databases in Section</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s5">8.8</span>. The next two sections, Sections <span class="s5">8.9 </span>and <span class="s5">8.10</span>, analyze <span class="s1">BigTable </span>and <span class="s1">Megastore </span>systems.</p>
