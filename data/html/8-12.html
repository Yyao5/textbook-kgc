<p class="p1">A 2011 article in the journal <span class="s1">Science </span>[<span class="s2">164</span>] discusses the volume of information stored, processed, and</p>
<p class="p1">transferred through networks. [<span class="s2">251</span>] is a comprehensive study of the storage technology until 2003.</p>
<p class="p1">Network File System Versions 2, 3, and 4 are discussed in [<span class="s2">314</span>], [<span class="s2">286</span>], and [<span class="s2">287</span>], respectively.</p>
<p class="p1">References [<span class="s2">250</span>] and [<span class="s2">170</span>] provide a wealth of information about the Andrew File System; [<span class="s2">165</span>] and [<span class="s2">255</span>] discuss in detail the Sprite File System. Other file systems such as Locus, Apollo, and the</p>
<p class="p1">Remote File System (RFS) are discussed in [<span class="s2">365</span>], [<span class="s2">211</span>], and [<span class="s2">35</span>], respectively. Storage systems are</p>
<p class="p1">also discussed in [103,105].</p>
<p class="p1">The General Parallel File System (GPFS) developed at IBM and its precursor, the TigerShark multimedia</p>
<p class="p1">file system, are presented in [<span class="s2">317</span>] and [<span class="s2">159</span>]. A good source for information about the Google</p>
<p class="p1">File System is [<span class="s2">136</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">The development of <span class="s1">Chubby </span>is covered in [<span class="s2">61</span>]. <span class="s1">NoSQL </span>databases are analyzed in several papers,</p>
<p class="p1">including [<span class="s2">335</span>], [<span class="s2">157</span>], and [<span class="s2">66</span>]. <span class="s1">BigTable </span>and <span class="s1">Megastore</span>, developed at Google, are discussed in</p>
<p class="p1">[<span class="s2">73</span>] and [<span class="s2">37</span>]. Evaluation of datastores is presented in [59] and a cloud storage abstraction for portable</p>
<p class="p1">applications is introduced in [166].</p>
<p class="p1">Oracleâ€™s Lustre file system is discussed in [276], a cost storage analysis in [299], and an overview</p>
<p class="p1">of cloud storage is covered in [327].</p>
