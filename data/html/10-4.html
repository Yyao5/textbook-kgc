<p class="p1">Two most important concepts for understanding complex systems are <span class="s1">emergence </span>and <span class="s1">self-organization</span>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emergence </span>lacks a clear and widely accepted definition, but it is generally understood as <span class="s1">a property of a</span></p>
<p class="p2">system that is not predictable from the properties of individual system components. <span class="s2">There is a continuum</span></p>
<p class="p1">of emergence spanning multiple scales of organization. Halley andWinkler argue that simple emergence</p>
<p class="p1">occurs in systems at or near thermodynamic equilibrium, whereas complex emergence occurs only in</p>
<p class="p1">nonlinear systems driven far from equilibrium by the input of matter or energy [<span class="s3">153</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Physical phenomena that do not manifest themselves at microscopic scales but occur at macroscopic</p>
<p class="p1">scale are manifestations of emergence. For example, temperature is a manifestation of the microscopic</p>
<p class="p1">behavior of large ensembles of particles. For such systems at equilibrium, the temperature is proportional</p>
<p class="p1">with the average kinetic energy per degree of freedom. This is not true for ensembles of a small number</p>
<p class="p1">of particles. Even the laws of classical mechanics can be viewed as limiting cases of quantum mechanics</p>
<p class="p1">applied to large objects.</p>
<p class="p1">Emergence could be critical for complex systems such as financial systems, the air-traffic system, and</p>
<p class="p1">the power grid. The May 6, 2010, event in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 600 points</p>
<p class="p1">in a short period of time is a manifestation of emergence. The cause of this failure of the trading systems</p>
<p class="p1">was attributed to interactions of trading systems developed independently and owned by organizations</p>
<p class="p1">that work together, but their actions were motivated by self-interest.</p>
<p class="p1">A recent paper [<span class="s3">329</span>] points out that dynamic coalitions of software-intensive systems used for</p>
<p class="p1">financial activities pose serious challenges because there is no central authority and there are no means</p>
<p class="p1">to control the behavior of the individual trading systems. The failures of the power grid (for example,</p>
<p class="p1">the Northeastern U.S. blackout of 2003) can also be attributed to emergence; indeed, during the first few hours of this event, the cause of the failure could not be identified due to the large number of independent</p>
<p class="p1">systems involved. Only later was it established that multiple causes, including the deregulation of the</p>
<p class="p1">electricity market and the inadequacy of the transmission lines of the power grid, contributed to this</p>
<p class="p1">failure.</p>
<p class="p1">Informally, self-organization means synergetic activities of elements, when no single element acts</p>
<p class="p1">as a coordinator and the global patterns of behavior are distributed [<span class="s3">137</span>,<span class="s3">320</span>]. The intuitive meaning</p>
<p class="p1">of self-organization is captured by this observation of mathematician Alan Turing [<span class="s3">355</span>]: “Global order</p>
<p class="p1">can arise from local interactions.”</p>
<p class="p1">Self-organization is prevalent in nature; for example, in chemistry this process is responsible for</p>
<p class="p1">molecular self-assembly, for self-assembly of monolayers, for the formation of liquid and colloidal</p>
<p class="p1">crystals, and in many other instances. Spontaneous folding of proteins and other biomacromolecules,</p>
<p class="p1">the formation of lipid bilayer membranes, the flocking behavior of various species, the creation of</p>
<p class="p1">structures by social animals – all are manifestations of self-organization of biological systems.</p>
<p class="p1">Inspired by biological systems, self-organization was proposed for the organization of different types</p>
<p class="p1">of computing and communication systems [<span class="s3">169</span>,<span class="s3">231</span>], including sensor networks, space exploration</p>
<p class="p1">[<span class="s3">167</span>], or even economic systems [<span class="s3">200</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">The generic attributes of complex systems exhibiting self-organization are summarized in Table <span class="s3">10.1</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Nonlinearity of physical systems used to build computing and communication systems has countless</p>
<p class="p1">manifestations and consequences. For example, when the clock rate of a microprocessor doubles, the</p>
<p class="p1">power dissipation increases from 2<span class="s4">2 </span><span class="s1">= </span>4 to 2<span class="s4">3 </span><span class="s1">= </span>8 times, depending of the solid-state technology</p>
<p class="p1">used. This means that the heat-removal system of much faster microprocessors has to use a different</p>
<p class="p1">technology when we double the speed. This nonlinearity is ultimately the reason that in the last few</p>
<p class="p1">years we have seen the clock rate of general-purpose microprocessors increasing only slightly,<span class="s5">3 </span>while</p>
<p class="p1">the increased number of transistors postulated by Moore’s law, allow companies such as Intel and</p>
<p class="p1">AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) to build multicore chips. This example also illustrates the so-called</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">incommensurate scaling, </span>another attribute of complex systems. Incommensurate scaling means that, when the size of the system or one of its important attributes such as speed increases, different system</p>
<p class="p1">components are subject to different scaling rules.</p>
<p class="p1">The fact that computing and communication systems operate far from equilibrium is clearly illustrated</p>
<p class="p1">by the traffic carried by the Internet. There are patterns of traffic specific to the time of the day, but</p>
<p class="p1">there is no steady-state. The many scales of the organization and the fact that there are different patterns</p>
<p class="p1">at different scales is also clear in the Internet, which is a collection of networks where, in turn, each</p>
<p class="p1">network is also a collection of smaller networks, each one with its own specific traffic patterns.</p>
<p class="p1">The concept of <span class="s1">phase transition </span>comes from thermodynamics and describes the transformation, often</p>
<p class="p1">discontinuous, of a system from one phase or state to another, as a result of a change in the environment.</p>
<p class="p1">Examples of phase transitions are <span class="s1">freezing</span>, which is a transition from liquid to solid, and its reverse,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">melting</span>; <span class="s1">deposition</span>, which is a transition from gas to solid, and its reverse, <span class="s1">sublimation</span>; and <span class="s1">ionization</span>,</p>
<p class="p1">which is a transition from gas to plasma, and its reverse, <span class="s1">recombination</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Phase transitions can occur in computing and communication systems due to avalanche phenomena,</p>
<p class="p1">when the process designed to eliminate the cause of an undesirable behavior leads to a further deterioration</p>
<p class="p1">of the system state. A typical example is thrashing due to competition among several memory intensive</p>
<p class="p1">processes, which leads to excessive page faults. Another example is acute congestion, which</p>
<p class="p1">can cause a total collapse of a network; the routers start dropping packets and, unless congestion avoidance</p>
<p class="p1">and congestion control means are in place and operate effectively, the load increases as senders</p>
<p class="p1">retransmit packets and the congestion increases. To prevent such phenomena, some form of <span class="s1">negative</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">feedback </span>has to be built into the system.</p>
<p class="p1">A defining attribute of <span class="s1">self-organization </span>is scalability – the ability of the system to grow without</p>
<p class="p1">affecting its global function(s). Complex systems, encountered in nature or man-made, exhibit an</p>
<p class="p1">intriguing property: They enjoy a <span class="s1">scale-free organization </span>[<span class="s3">39</span>,<span class="s3">40</span>]. This property reflects one of the few</p>
<p class="p1">attributes of self-organization that can be precisely quantified. The scale-free organization can best be</p>
<p class="p1">explained in terms of the network model of the system, a random graph [<span class="s3">53</span>] with vertices representing</p>
<p class="p1">the entities and the links representing the relationships among them. In a scale-free organization, the</p>
<p class="p1">probability <span class="s1">P(m) </span>that a vertex interacts with <span class="s1">m </span>other vertices decays as a power law, <span class="s1">P(m) ≈ m</span><span class="s6">−γ </span>,</p>
<p class="p1">with <span class="s1">γ </span>a real number, regardless of the type and function of the system, the identity of its constituents,</p>
<p class="p1">and the relationships among them.</p>
<p class="p1">Empirical data available for social networks, power grids, theWeb, or the citation of scientific papers</p>
<p class="p1">confirm this trend. As an example of a social network, consider a collaborative graph of movie actors on</p>
<p class="p1">which links are present if two actors were ever cast in the same movie; in this case, <span class="s1">γ ≈ </span>2<span class="s1">.</span>3. The power</p>
<p class="p1">grid of theWestern United States has some 5<span class="s1">,</span>000 vertices representing power-generating stations, and in</p>
<p class="p1">this case, <span class="s1">γ ≈ </span>4. For theWorldWideWeb the exponent is <span class="s1">γ ≈ </span>2<span class="s1">.</span>1; this means that the probability that <span class="s1">m</span></p>
<p class="p1">pages point to one page is <span class="s1">P(m) ≈ m</span><span class="s6">−</span><span class="s4">2</span><span class="s6">.</span><span class="s4">1 </span>[<span class="s3">40</span>]. Recent studies indicate that <span class="s1">γ ≈ </span>3 for the citation of scientific</p>
<p class="p1">papers. The larger the network, the closer a power law with <span class="s1">γ ≈ </span>3 approximates the distribution [<span class="s3">39</span>].</p>
