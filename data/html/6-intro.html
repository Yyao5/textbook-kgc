<p class="p1">Resource management is a core function of any man-made system. It affects the three basic criteria for</p>
<p class="p1">the evaluation of a system: performance, functionality, and cost. An inefficient resource management</p>
<p class="p1">has a direct negative effect on performance and cost and an indirect effect on the functionality of a</p>
<p class="p1">system. Indeed, some functions provided by the system may become too expensive or may be avoided</p>
<p class="p1">due to poor performance.</p>
<p class="p1">A cloud is a complex system with a very large number of shared resources subject to unpredictable</p>
<p class="p1">requests and affected by external events it cannot control. Cloud resource management requires complex</p>
<p class="p1">policies and decisions for multi-objective optimization. Cloud resource management is extremely</p>
<p class="p1">challenging because of the complexity of the system, which makes it impossible to have accurate global</p>
<p class="p1">state information, and because of the unpredictable interactions with the environment.</p>
<p class="p1">The strategies for resource management associated with the three cloud delivery models, <span class="s1">IaaS, PaaS</span>,</p>
<p class="p1">and <span class="s1">SaaS</span>, differ from one another. In all cases the cloud service providers are faced with large, fluctuating</p>
<p class="p1">loads that challenge the claim of cloud elasticity. In some cases, when a spike can be predicted, the</p>
<p class="p1">resources can be provisioned in advance, e.g., for Web services subject to seasonal spikes. For an</p>
<p class="p1">unplanned spike, the situation is slightly more complicated. <span class="s1">Auto Scaling </span>can be used for unplanned</p>
<p class="p1">spike loads, provided that (a) there is a pool of resources that can be released or allocated on demand</p>
<p class="p1">and (b) there is a monitoring system that allows a control loop to decide in real time to reallocate</p>
<p class="p1">resources. Auto Scaling is supported by <span class="s1">PaaS </span>services such as Google App Engine. <span class="s1">Auto Scaling </span>for</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IaaS</span>, discussed in Section <span class="s2">6.14</span>, is complicated due to the lack of standards.</p>
<p class="p1">It has been argued for some time that in a cloud, where changes are frequent and unpredictable,</p>
<p class="p1">centralized control is unlikely to provide continuous service and performance guarantees. Indeed, centralized</p>
<p class="p1">control cannot provide adequate solutions to the host of cloud management policies that have</p>
<p class="p1">to be enforced. Autonomic policies are of great interest due to the scale of the system, the large number</p>
<p class="p1">of service requests, the large user population, and the unpredictability of the load. The ratio of the mean</p>
<p class="p1">to the peak resource needs can be very large.</p>
<p class="p1">We start our discussion with an overview of policies and mechanisms for cloud resource management</p>
<p class="p1">in Section <span class="s2">6.1</span>. A control theoretic approach to resource allocation is discussed in Sections <span class="s2">6.2</span>, <span class="s2">6.3</span>, and</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6.4</span>. A machine learning algorithm for coordination of specialized autonomic performance managers</p>
<p class="p1">is presented in Section <span class="s2">6.5</span>. In Section <span class="s2">6.6 </span>we discuss a utility model for resource allocation for a Web</p>
<p class="p1">service. Next we present resource bundling and combinatorial auctions in Section <span class="s2">6.7</span>. The fair queuing,</p>
<p class="p1">start-time fair queuing, and borrowed virtual time scheduling algorithms are analyzed in Sections <span class="s2">6.9</span>,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">6.10</span>, and <span class="s2">6.11</span>, respectively. Scheduling with deadlines and the impact of application scaling on resource</p>
<p class="p1">management are presented in Sections <span class="s2">6.12</span>, <span class="s2">6.13</span>, and <span class="s2">6.14</span>, respectively.</p>
