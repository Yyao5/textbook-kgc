<p class="p1">Cloud resource management poses new and extremely challenging problems, so it should be no surprise</p>
<p class="p1">that it is a very active area of research. A fair number of papers, including [<span class="s1">22</span>,<span class="s1">65</span>,<span class="s1">75</span>,<span class="s1">77</span>,<span class="s1">113</span>,<span class="s1">114</span>,<span class="s1">115</span>,<span class="s1">120</span>,</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">138</span>,<span class="s1">139</span>,<span class="s1">151</span>,<span class="s1">155</span>,<span class="s1">162</span>,<span class="s1">184</span>,<span class="s1">238</span>,<span class="s1">275</span>,<span class="s1">307</span>,<span class="s1">313</span>] are dedicated to various resource management policies.</p>
<p class="p1">Several papers are concerned with SLA and QoS; e.g., [<span class="s1">4</span>] covers SLA-driven capacity management</p>
<p class="p1">and [<span class="s1">23</span>] covers SLA-based resource allocation policies. Dynamic request scheduling of applications</p>
<p class="p1">subject to SLA requirements is presented in [<span class="s1">54</span>]. The QoS in clouds is analyzed in [<span class="s1">121</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Autonomic computing [<span class="s1">130</span>] is the subject of papers such as [<span class="s1">24</span>], which covers energy-aware resource</p>
<p class="p1">allocation in autonomic computing; [<span class="s1">188</span>], which analyzes policies for autonomic computing based on</p>
<p class="p1">utility functions; [<span class="s1">187</span>], which discusses coordination of multiple autonomic managers and power performance</p>
<p class="p1">tradeoffs; and [<span class="s1">9</span>], which presents autonomic management of cloud services subject to</p>
<p class="p1">availability guarantees.</p>
<p class="p1">Auctions in which participants can bid on combinations of items or <span class="s2">packages </span>are called <span class="s2">combinatorial</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">auctions </span>[<span class="s1">93</span>]. Such auctions provide a relatively simple, scalable, and tractable solution to cloud resource</p>
<p class="p1">allocation. Two recent combinatorial auction algorithms are the <span class="s2">simultaneous clock auction </span>[<span class="s1">29</span>] and</p>
<p class="p1">the <span class="s2">clock proxy auction </span>[<span class="s1">30</span>]; the algorithm discussed in this chapter and introduced in [<span class="s1">333</span>] is called</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">the </span>ascending clock auction (ASCA)<span class="s3">.</span></p>
<p class="p1">An authoritative reference on fault tolerance is [<span class="s1">31</span>]; applications of control theory to resource allocation</p>
<p class="p1">discussed in [<span class="s1">70</span>,<span class="s1">109</span>] cover resource multiplexing in data centers. Admission control policies are</p>
<p class="p1">discussed in [<span class="s1">150</span>]. Power and performance management are the subject of [<span class="s1">202</span>], and performance management</p>
<p class="p1">for cluster-basedWeb services is covered in [<span class="s1">280</span>]. Autonomic management of heterogeneous</p>
<p class="p1">workloads is discussed in [<span class="s1">344</span>], and application placement controllers are the topic of [<span class="s1">346</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">Scheduling and resource allocation are also covered by numerous papers: a batch queuing system</p>
<p class="p1">on clouds with <span class="s2">Hadoop and HBase </span>is presented in [<span class="s1">387</span>]; data flow-driven scheduling for business</p>
<p class="p1">applications is covered in [<span class="s1">106</span>]. Scalable thread scheduling is the topic of [<span class="s1">374</span>]. Scheduling of</p>
<p class="p1">real-time services in cloud computing is presented in [<span class="s1">220</span>]. The Open Grid Forum (OGF) Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) is involved in the definition of virtualization formats and APIs for <span class="s2">IaaS</span></p>
<p class="p1">[<span class="s1">175</span>] presents a performance analyzer.</p>
