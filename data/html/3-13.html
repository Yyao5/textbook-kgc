<p class="p1">two new instance types (Large and Extra-Large) were added, followed in 2008 by two more types, <span class="s1">High-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CPU Medium </span>and <span class="s1">High-CPU Extra-Large</span>. New features include static IP addresses, availability zones,</p>
<p class="p1">and user-selectable kernels as well as the Block Store (EBS). Amazon <span class="s1">EC2 </span>has been in full production</p>
