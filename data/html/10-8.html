<p class="p1">Large-scale systems could be classified as monolithic when all the components work in concert under the</p>
<p class="p1">control of a supervising authority and as <span class="s1">Systems of Systems </span>(SoS) collections of independent systems</p>
<p class="p1">with limited interactions. An analysis of the defining characteristics of an SoS appeared in 1998 [<span class="s2">237</span>].</p>
<p class="p1">According to this study, a system of systems has five important attributes:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. </span>The individual components of an SoS, are independent and can be operated alone, disconnected</p>
<p class="p1">from the other system components.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. </span>The components enjoy managerial independence and in fact do operate independently for some</p>
<p class="p1">periods of time.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. </span>The system of systems continually evolves in time as new functions are added while others are</p>
<p class="p1">removed.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. </span>The system is able to perform functions that cannot be performed by any of its components alone;</p>
<p class="p1">in other words, it has an emergent behavior.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. </span>The components exchange only information; thus, they can be geographically distributed over a large</p>
<p class="p1">area. As the performance of interconnection networks improves, this geographic spread becomes</p>
<p class="p1">less and less noticeable and does not affect the function or the performance of the SoS. This is in</p>
<p class="p1">contrast to systems that exchange mass or energy when the distance between components plays a</p>
<p class="p1">significant role.</p>
<p class="p1">Managerial control distinguishes several classes of systems of systems. A <span class="s1">direct system </span>has a central</p>
<p class="p1">management that steers the long-term operation of the ensemble of systems; these systems operate</p>
<p class="p1">independently most of the time but are subordinated to the common goal. The example of a direct system</p>
<p class="p1">given in [<span class="s2">237</span>] is an air-defense system in which the individual components can operate independently</p>
<p class="p1">but are subject to the requirement to defend the air space.</p>
<p class="p1">In the case of <span class="s1">collaborative systems </span>such as the Internet, the component systems collaborate voluntarily,</p>
<p class="p1">subject to a previously agreed set of rules and objectives. Finally, <span class="s1">virtual systems </span>do not have a</p>
<p class="p1">central authority to manage their operations. The World Wide Web is an example of a virtual system;</p>
<p class="p1">individual sites may or may not follow policies regarding the structure or the contents of the documents,</p>
<p class="p1">the naming conventions, or the site navigation rules.</p>
