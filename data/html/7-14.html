<p class="p1">The Internet is a global network based on the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP); its origins can be traced</p>
<p class="p1">back to 1965, when Ivan Sutherland, the head of the Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO)</p>
<p class="p1">at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), encouraged Lawrence Roberts, who had worked</p>
<p class="p1">previously at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratories, to become the chief scientist at ISTO Technologies and to</p>
<p class="p1">initiate a networking project based on packet switching rather than circuit switching.</p>
<p class="p1">In the early 1960s Leonard Kleinrock at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) developed</p>
<p class="p1">the theoretical foundations of packet networks and, in the early 1970s, for hierarchical routing in</p>
<p class="p1">packet-switching networks. Kleinrock published the first paper on packet-switching theory in 1961 and</p>
<p class="p1">the first book on the subject in 1964.</p>
<p class="p1">In August 1968 DARPA released a request for quotation (RFQ) for the development of packet</p>
<p class="p1">switches called interface message processors (IMPs). A group from Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN)</p>
<p class="p1">won the contract. Several researchers and their teams including Robert Kahn from BBN, Lawrence</p>
<p class="p1">Roberts from DARPA, Howard Frank from Network Analysis Corporation, and Leonard Kleinrock</p>
<p class="p1">from UCLA, played a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design. The idea of open architecture</p>
<p class="p1">networking was first introduced by Kahn in 1972, and his collaboration with Vint Cerf</p>
<p class="p1">from Stanford led to the design of TCP/IP. Three groups, one at Stanford, one at BBN, and one at</p>
<p class="p1">UCLA, won the DARPA contract to implement TCP/IP.</p>
<p class="p1">In 1969 BBN installed the first IMP at UCLA. The first two nodes the ARPANET interconnected</p>
<p class="p1">were the Network Measurement Center at UCLA’s School of Engineering and Applied Science and</p>
<p class="p1">SRI International in Menlo Park, California. Two more nodes were added at UC Santa Barbara and the</p>
<p class="p1">University of Utah. By the end of 1971 there were 15 sites interconnected by ARPANET.</p>
<p class="p1">Ethernet technology, developed by Bob Metcalfe at Xerox PARC in 1973, and other local area</p>
<p class="p1">network technologies, such as token-passing rings, allowed the personal computers and workstations</p>
<p class="p1">to be connected to the Internet in the 1980s. As the number of Internet hosts increased, it was no longer</p>
<p class="p1">feasible to have a single table of all hosts and their addresses. The Domain Name System (DNS) was</p>
<p class="p1">invented by Paul Mockapetris of USC/ISI. The DNS permitted a scalable distributed mechanism for</p>
<p class="p1">resolving hierarchical host names into an Internet address.</p>
<p class="p1">UC Berkeley, with support from DARPA, rewrote the TCP/IP code developed at BBN and incorporated</p>
<p class="p1">it into the <span class="s1">Unix </span>BSD system. In 1985 Dennis Jennings started the NSFNET program at NSF to</p>
<p class="p1">support the general research and academic communities.</p>
